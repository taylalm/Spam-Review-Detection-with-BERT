Our room contained a air system which only produces heat in the winter and cold in the summer, so if it's one of those 80 degree days in February or March, I suppose you're screwed. Piano in the lobby needs tuning. Lobby is adjacent (attached opening) to Mike Ditka's. Bed excellent, TV above average, bathroom and cleanliness meet the standards.

It's close to pretty much everything! We also got a great deal, a single king-sized bed room for $89/night. The hotel itself, was gorgeous-the lobby ceiling was breath-taking! The one con with the hotel was that the room was TINY. It's the smallest hotel room I've ever been in! But I guess being in the City, you're not going to spending much time in the room anyways.

My room was a suite and overlooked Michigan Avenue and the Apple Store (with its grass roof...very cool sight). The room was sparkling clean, the internet access was fast and easy to access and the room was quiet. They even do a turn down service in the evening...something I hardly ever see any more. I was there for a conference. All food and service was excellent. This is also a great location with shopping and restaurants everywhere adjacent. I very much recommend this hotel.

This W definitely felt like that - especially when you went upstairs with the low ceiling hallways and tiny rooms. The overall decor, furnishings, and look of the hotel was probably a 3 - it wasn't the most creative W hotel lobby I've seen or rooms I've been in.  My Wonderful room was tinyyyy - if I sat at the desk to do work, I couldn't scoot my chair out all the way without hitting the bed - Anyone larger than me probably would have had trouble getting into the seat to begin with and I'm a 5 foot 2 small asian girl. The bathroom was also very tiny with a very tiny sink. It was pretty much impossible to wash my face in the sink without splashing water all over the tiny counter. That being said, for the week that I spent here I definitely started feeling at home and none of the above mattered to me. The W hotel bed is HEAVENLY. The room was well appointed and everything was placed in an space efficient way and I had enough room to function comfortably. Flat screen TV and cable available. Pretty fast wireless internet (it came free with my room - not sure if it applies to everyone), and I had a radio in my room so I was jammin out to music most of the time I was in the room. I was having an awesome time in my room. What put the icing on the cake for this hotel was that the service was AMAZING. Like possibly one of the best staff I've ever encountered at a hotel in my life. And not the white glove butler type service you get at the Four Seasons where they HAVE to be at your beck and call, but everyone I encountered was sooo genuinely friendly - from the security guard who let me back into my room when I locked myself out of my room with no shoes on at 2 am, the concierge and the front desk, the cleaning ladies actually remembered my name, what room I was in, gave me extra bliss products. I called down once for a toothbrush and they came instantaneously fast. The guy who brought me room service was also extremely extremely cheerful and nice. Every interaction with a staff here literally wowed me and left me with a smile on my face.  Now for some objective notes: Location is awesome.... if you're in Chicago for work. It's in the heart of the financial district and within walking distance of most large companies as well as near two L train stops. That being said.... everything in Chicago's financial district (food-wise) shuts down at like 8 pm.. no joke and the streets in general were pretty deserted. So.. because I work insane hours, room service was my best friend. Room service... argh.. despite their service being so amazing.. as can be expected from a hotel, it takes like 30 to 45 mins for them to bring you food - Comes on time though if you order breakfast.

Personnel: Paula, the catering manager, was amazing. She was willing to accommodate any suggestions I had and worked wonderfully with our vendors. She is so responsive, and truly cared about making the day fun and memorable for everyone. Other hotel staff was very friendly, without being fake (you know the type). Everyone we encountered, from the wait staff to the valet parking staff, was so courteous. Rooms: We had a penthouse suite (bi-level with fabulous city views) that was a great size and easily fit 10 girls plus hair stylists & a makeup artist getting ready pre-ceremony. We also had a hotel block here for guests & all were happy with their rooms (small touches like the fresh orchids in the bathroom went a long way!) Logistics: I love the set up of the space (2nd floor cocktail hour with a private bar and 3rd floor dinner/dancing). The unique shape of the rooms makes it interesting and the floor to ceiling windows offer a great view of the activity on the street.  Food: We received so many raves about our food! I honestly didn't get a chance to eat much of it (although at the tasting, everything was delicious). The portion sizes were very generous.

We've booked with W Chicago-Lakeshore in the past and there has always been something but this time around was the final straw. I booked a hotel stay for one of my colleagues and my colleague was suppose to check in on Sunday. I called a week prior to his check in date to prepaid for his stay (since every time I asked for a CC Auth form, I never received it). The account woman took everything over the phone and said my colleague was all set. Here comes Sunday, the day my colleague is set to check in. They will not let him check in because they require him to put his card down for room & tax. My question is...what's the point of prepaying for a room when the guest is going to have to put down his/her card for ROOM & TAX plus incidentals. My colleague called me explaining the situation that Sunday night. Then I called the hotel and spoke to the night manger, who name begins with a G. She herself told me that she can see that an authorization has been made to his account but the account woman clearly didn't input the hard swipe. Another question I have to ask, why is that our problem? That was negligence on your employee's part not ours. Then, for her to say we have to put down for incidentals and a night stay in order to stay at the hotel(which would have been $650+, after I repeatedly told her I would send the details over to her first thing in the morning and my guest can not pay for this. I don't think Ms. G understands that everyone doesn't have $650+ to give at the drop of a hat. Which is why the company was paying for his travel.To cut a long story short, my colleague was waiting outside of the hotel for about to 2hrs, at night after flying in from NY to be told he couldn't stay at their hotel because a W Chicago Lakeshore employee was negligent in processing a CC Auth form. Which lead for me to intensely search for a hotel for my colleague to stay in for that night and the next 3 days. I am just beyond frustrated with this hotel. They treated us like we're new to doing business with them and we don't book a lot of our colleagues and clients at their hotel. Never again.

For the price, the hotel and our room were surprisingly good. No free wifi but otherwise the amenities were satisfactory. Apparently there was a renovation recently - the room was clean and comfortably modern. Checking in and out was relatively smooth. There were two main things that bothered me. First, the chaotic nature of the hotel lobby. It was a busy weekend (air and water show) and I felt like they weren't quite prepared for it. It was raining the first morning, and it took about 30 minutes to get a taxi through the teeming mass of hydrophobic hotel goers. There wasn't much organization and the hotel didn't seem to have any pull to get a good supply of cabs. Second, the concierge desk was overall pretty useless and almost, well, snotty. Also, it costs $20 to rent an umbrella. It's refundable, but you can't put it on your bill and you can't use a card. It's $20 cash or kick rocks. The location is good but I thought the hotels a bit further north gave a better starting point to get around the city.

Inside, my room was nice, and they did a great job with my dry cleaning - surprising, actually. Better than my home dry cleaner. One pet peeve of mine is hotels who say they have free wireless access but fail to have enough bandwidth to support the customers. My first day there, I watched a lot of content via their in-house wireless, but the second day I got blocked out constantly. Don't know whether it's their network or the source, but I suspect it was theirs. Still, I will overlook that and still give them a 5, because not having service got me off my butt and outside into the sunshine, which isn't all bad, is it?

The hotel is connected to an italian restaurant Fornetto Mei which also includes a bar and a connecting lounge area between the hotel and restaurant with comfy sofas and seating to relax with friends. The hotel is just off Michigan Avenue near the Water Tower Place - a great area with lots of great restaurants, sights and shopping. If you have a car, the valet parking is very convenient.

Great service (the front desk found us a pizza place that would deliver at 2am and they also helped us with an emergency wedding toast print out situation). However, a few quibbles: 1) room service that ends at 10:30pm (not good for those of us arriving late at night from the west coast - hence the needed pizza delivery above), 2) no vending machines anywhere in the hotel, meaning a bottle of water or a Sprite was nearly impossible to get late at night; 3) business center that closes before 6pm (hence the emergency printout situation above); 4) gym access by payment only - not complimentary for hotel guests; and 5) no in-room coffee maker. While I appreciate the extra service they provide to make up for some of these amenities, I have travelled quite a lot for both business and pleasure, and I have come to expect the above amenities to be standard.

My experience at the W, as a bride, was fantastic. I was given a choice of room- a regular room for free or a suite for the discounted rate my guests had for a normal room. I went with the suite. It was AWESOME. I checked in Thursday afternoon with a ton of stuff and the bellhops were super helpful loading and unloading all my junk. The first thing I did was order a caesar salad and glass of white wine via room service- both were great (if overpriced) and I loved the little shot glass of gummie bears on the side. Parking at the W is a total rip-off but I was able to get a discounted parking pass for myself. Getting the car from the valet usually took about 20 minutes so I learned to call ahead. I enjoy the club atmosphere on the first level (and in the elevators). I thought it was really fun. We had some pre-wedding fun at the bar on Thursday- the drinks are pricey but very good. The day of the wedding went off without a hitch. My suite was more than big enough for all of us to have our hair and make-up done there. We got some great photos in the lobby of the hotel. When my husband and I returned to the suite after the wedding a bottle of champgane was on ice for us with some delicious chocolate truffles and a note thanking us for hosting our wedding guests at the W. Classy! I did not give 5 stars in this review as the guest rooms were SO SMALL! Nobody complained about it, as they got a great rate, but they were ridiculously small. Also, I was charged $4 per bag to hand out our welcome bags.

The location is wonderfully convenient. The rooms? Tiny as hell and the walls that separate them are thin as can be. I was treated to a rather spectacular fight from a somewhere-in-the-vicinity room at 2 am. There's nothing special about the rooms. The bedding is just ""meh"". On the 9th floor, the air conditioning never seems to be correct It was colder in the room than it was in the refrigerator. Speaking of odd things, there's no dresser space. Where am I supposed to store my man panties? There's a closet, but honestly - I'm not going to hang my Andrew Christians up. Drawer space! Whatever space there might have been under the giant TV was taken up with the minibar offerings. The bathroom was very nice and had a tub, which I prefer over a standing shower - as long as it's clean. The Drake does housekeeping very well. Excellent soaps, shampoo, conditioner & body creams as well. As pointed out by Omar, there's no wifi in the rooms. So, be prepared to shell out $12.95 a day for internet access that requires an ethernet jack or bring your own internet access stick. The food, though, was quite good and I have to give the Drake a lot of praise for doing gluten free very well.  I can take a so-so room. I can't take terrible food. This was pretty darned good, and I was the envy of my colleagues all week, as my employer arranged for special meals at breakfast and lunch. If you have mobility issues, this could be a rough patch if you're using the meeting space. Lots of stairs. Frankly, I loved the stairs. It was the only exercise I got - and I did lust for the very nice gym which features Precor equipment across multiple rooms.  The front desk staff is superb and the security is very good. I got the fish eye once or twice as I meandered back from Jamba Juice. Perhaps it was the tight jeans and t-shirt? I just didn't dress the part of a Drake guest, perhaps. The hotel itself is extraordinarily convenient to shopping. Gucci is across the street, and that's just the start of the permanent damage you can do to your credit rating.  Rush Street is about a 5 minute walk away.

A lot of freakiness going on. But when they started the juke music...I thought...I did not pay $10 for juke music, if I wanted juke music then I would've gone to a ghetto high school homecoming. Somehow I think that the crowd is way young for my age (I'm 24). But I think they're some cute looking gay guys there and I made out with him (I'm straight). Hehe.

The cons - preeeetttty sure our room wasn't cleaned before we checked in (dirty towels, used dry cleaning bags on the closet floor, popcorn on the floor, etc). The rooms are kinda dated.

There is free internet access, perfect to feed my yelp addiction.  Business center is open 24 hours, and printing and computers are free. I came here late last nite after the yelp event, and they let me check in by phone, which definitely scored bonus points. They have a fitness center (3 treadmills, 3 ellipticals, 2 bikes, free weights, and a multiuse weight machine for lat pulldowns, shoulder work, etc) and offer access to Crunch a couple of doors down. They also have an indoor pool and hot tub. Adjacent to Weber Grill, their room service is from there or Buca di Beppo.

We stayed in a standard king, which was over 500 square feet! I love boutique hotels because they have so much more charm, and this one had a lot of it. Downstairs, they have the restaurant Bice, which is very classy too. It's true that the little things make this place so charming such as: a small living room, a designer remote control, Aveda products, excellent bathrooms with nice lighting and a bathrobe, free umbrellas, complementary passes to EQUINOX fitness, 3 telephones, electronic maid service displays, and a newspaper hung on the door in a cute little Talbott bag. Additionally, the room came with a lot of Chicago magazines for hot spots, as well as a beautiful Small Luxury Hotels of the world book (which is free for you to take and very handy!) Book online and you should also receive a $15 breakfast credit. Try the waffles if you're a fan. They're really good.

Outside the elevator banks on each floor is a telescope so that you can peek across at Lake Michigan, the beach, Navy Pier, the afterwork booze cruises that go by around 5:30 PM...such an awesome touch. I also like how the room design is much more ""Midwestern chic"" than any of the Ws in New York, with the wood paneling and shutters and whatnot. The lobby decor is much quirkier than I would have expected, too (the only Ws I'm really familiar with are the heavy-on-the-charcoal-gray Times Square and Union Square, after all). I checked in right after the Horrible Apocalyptic Tornado Thunderstorms of '07 that had evacuated O'Hare's control tower, brought flights to a standstill, etc. and there was a chance I wouldn't be able to get in to check into my room. So I called the W in advance and asked about the situation, and they were remarkably pleasant and accommodating: ""We won't charge you if there are acts of God involved!"" Turns out I did get in, albeit around 1 AM, but the front desk team was still equally on top of things. There are only a few characteristically W-esque things that knock this down to four stars instead of five.

I'm going to say that, dollar for dollar, this is the nicest hotel I've stayed at in recent memory. Ended up paying around $130 a night with taxes for a room on the 21st floor with an amazing view looking North out to Lake Michigan. Room was very comfortable, loved the bathrooms, spacious, bed was perfect, and the furnishings were stylish. Only a few minor complaints - could hear people/thumpings/etc. through the walls at night, didn't really bother me but it did the Mrs. Location here is great - red line subway a few blocks away, and all sorts of pricey shopping if you're into that sort of thing. Bar scene at night was bustling, though I wouldn't recommend many of the bars, unless you want to rub elbows with graphic t-shirt douchebags. Gibson's steakhouse across the street was really solid, and there are some good quick places to grab breakfast if you don't feel like springing for room service.  Just like all the reviews have noted, the staff here was incredibly helpful and polite. They helped us book a river cruise and answered numerous other dumb tourist questions. When I made my reservation a few months prior, I explained it was for our anniversary - and upon our arrival we received a personalized note from the manager and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries. Obviously, the Chicago hotel market is very competitive, and this place understands that guests appreciate a staff willing to go the extra mile.  Again, I've been at nicer hotels, but if you are into value, I don't think you can beat Sutton Place.

I walked into my room using an old fashioned key with a pendant emblazoned with their signature Celtic armor/motif that repeats throughout the hotel... Only to find a woman brushing her teeth in her bras! Clearly I've been assigned the wrong room! Ok a fluke... Not a big deal. My new room was located on the 5th floor with a view of Washington street. No woman in bras but I was greeted by beautiful yellow wallpaper, fancy electronics and striking blue and white room scheme. I nestled into my bed, and cozied with a beer and organic kettle chips from the honor bar. I had a all day meeting starting at 6 a very important that I get good sleep. So far so good Except I was woken up at night constantly by the sound of construction of a new building across the street. It was a jackhammer (are jackhammers allowed at that time of day??!!) what was more perplexing is that a lot of rooms faced Washington. Am I the only one who couldn't sleep through the noise?  Travelers beware. I love this hotel but please ask for a room away from Washington if you want sleep!

That's not a negative, simply a head's up. Prices are reasonable for the location: South Loop in Chicago, Within walking distance of Natural History Museum, right across the street from Grant Park, and close to Columbia College Chicago and DePaul. Easy drive to McCormick Place. Great location! Bed was comfortable, sheets were soft and in good condition. Pillows sucked. Worst pillows I've ever slept on- stuffed with lumpy little pieces of foam. They could/would not give me an extra pillow. A/C was super noisy but it worked. We stayed in a king suite, which is an open L-shaped room w/ a king bed, and a loveseat /single pull out bed in the 'L'. No privacy between the living and bedroom areas, so if that's an issue, get two rooms. No blanket for the pull out bed and three single size pillows for the whole room to use- all lumpy, btw. Fridge and microwave in the room. Again, it's an older city hotel so they don't splurge on space. Great views of the city. It's close to the ""El"" so you will hear the train rumbling by every 10-15 minutes during the day, less at night. Parking is valet with in and out privileges. It fills up quickly so you will have to call to specifically reserve a space or check-in early. We were unaware of this. There is a public valet parking garage right next door for a few dollars more but without in and out service. However, you are in such a great location that you can walk or take public transport or a taxi with no problems.

The weekend of our wedding was chaotic due to Chicago hitting record high temperature levels and causing havoc on the hotel's air conditioners. While there were moments of stress, significant praise is warranted for the special events director Sinisa and the head concierge Krista - always keeping their cool and ensuring that all of our guests received excellent service (including moving them to rooms with functioning a/c, and if this was not possible comping rooms at comparable hotels in the Magnificent Mile area). The guest rooms are the size you would expect for downtown chicago and the bed and finishings was extremely comfortable (we are in process of purchasing one for our new home). The amenities were amazing and we found the modern bathroom to be near spa quality. We had a suite on our wedding night and it was very spacious and well designed.

In terms of location the hotel is great. However, I felt that the hotel was a little dated. It is not as nice as other Westin locations I have visited. Our room did not even have the dual shower heads which Westin is known for. I was also a little disappointed in the service. We had arrived late Friday night and they only had one person working the front desk. Being a SPG Gold Preferred Guest I stood in the line designated for such members. However, the employee working the front desk decided to help other guests prior to me. I'm not even complaining about not getting preferential treatment. They walked in after me. We he finally decided to help me, he wasn't every enthusiastic about his job. Once checked in the employee did not even properly direct me to my room. I had to go back and ask where the elevators were. That's not the way to treat a customer, especially a loyal one! My stay wasn't all that bad.

Our 10th floor room overlooked a fire escape and the metal sides and roof of the pool. We couldn't see the street at all. The bathroom-aside from a posh sink-was similar to my grandma's.

But as far as the rooms... and people.. It seems as though they have some severe service/management/upkeep issues. Well, except Jessica is great! The rooms are small--not ""hotel in the city"" small, but Times Square Hotel in the City Small. (The room 10' wide and was no more than 160 square feet). The bathroom was extremely tiny, as I sat on the toilet my foot had to rest on the metal doorstop. But that's the least of their problems. The shower didn't drain, and I didn't want to take a bath. So I ended up taking a shower in water that got to be over 6"" deep...  I told the maid (who came and knocked on our door at 9, even though we were only staying one day and had requested a late check out--something a good hotel would make note of and not bother interrupting you over) ... they came and fixed it, but still a hassle. There was no room service menu in our room, just a ""Dining In"" book... But then there was a Room Service button on our phone, so I'm pretty sure they did have regular room service. We ordered breakfast, it took 45 minutes to get our order, then it came and it wasn't correct. They serve potatoes but didn't bring ketchup. They serve toast but didn't bring BUTTER? How can room service not bring butter for toast? It was $48 for an omelet/potatoes/toast, 2 scrambled eggs/bacon/potatoes/toast, and one orange juice. And it wasn't even good, neither of us finished eating even half of it. The room wasn't wide enough to have the TV in front of the bed, it was off to the side and didn't really pull out/rotate so you could watch it head on...  (BTW, someone else on here complained about it, but not having FOX News on their channel lineup is a good thing as far as I'm concerned.... ). If they really were as hip as they think they are, they could have easily put a flat panel TV on the wall in front of the bed... The lobby space is very architecturally pleasing; the hallways are filled with the wafting smell of gardenia, which I like.... The door man didn't bother to open the door for me as I was walking out, he just stood there watching... (maybe I'm being prissy, but he IS a door man, and he wasn't doing anything at the time, and he was standing right in front of the door). We were told wifi Internet was actually $25/day to use (which includes free calls, too... something I could care less about) not $15... Either way it's overpriced. The rooms were very loud. Every noise in the hallway, upstairs hotel room, adjacent room, outside cars, el, etc were heard.  Parking is $38 which is high but is probably fairly average for hotel rates, even though garages in the area aren't more than $20/day. I'm never staying here again, and will highly recommend against it to anyone who asks.  And if you do go, avoid room 609... As cute as it sounds, it's just bad news!

They assured me that they did...after a two day train trip my first thought when I walked in was to wash my clothes so I would have something to wear on the trip home....I was told the washer and dryer had been removed several weeks prior! I wound up washing what I could in bathroom sink then spent half the night and part of morning trying to blow dry my clothes with a hair dryer! Not good! Also when I checked in I gave my Amtrak card to the gal at front desk to make sure the points go to Amtrak...this was not done! They put my 'points' to their hotel instead even tho I made it clear as I was giving them my card!

Who cares about big bedrooms and excessive bathrooms - the hotel has attentive staff - smart, caring, and willing to make it work. Yes rooms are small, bathrooms awkward at times - but the vibe of the hotel is positive and the people I met, amazing. All willing to make it work for you. If the room first selected is not to your liking, ask again, I did. Finding my 'suite' in a dark corridor, weird layout and not at all safe feeling. I asked to move, and front desk found a much better room, same rate that worked. Every person I dealt with was kind, empathetic, and willing to beyond to make my experience better. Bar served neighborhood crowd (church choir) as well as out of town guests. And all were welcomed by nice bar tenders. The maid service was great and also real in a face to face conversation. I loved that bathrooms while tiny and awkwardly designed, were stocked with ""just enough"" NOT TOO MUCH towels, etc. SO I felt no guilt actually using and not worrying that other towels had been left to linger. Thank you Allerton, nice staffing, awesome location, and great experience.

Just stayed here for 3 nights this past weekend and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Being my first time ever staying in a Holiday Inn, I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, but we were greeted with genuinely friendly staff who were more than happy to hold our luggage (we arrived earlier than check in time) and suggest things for us to do and places to eat while we waited for our room to be cleaned. Free hot breakfast in the morning was better than the usual continental breakfast they offer at other hotels..complete with cereal, eggs filled with cheese, pancakes, bagels, sausage, muffins, biscuits, assorted juices, and hot cinnamon rolls (although we didn't take advantage of this every morning since Chicago has so many yummy breakfast spots). Staff were always available to hail cabs for us. One guy even went down the block to flag one down! Extra tip for him of course. Hotel is walking distance to some nightlife, restaurants, and shopping. If you get the GO Chicago card, the greyline will pick you up a few blocks from the hotel so you can save money on transportation there. Only complaints: small hallways and small rooms! Super cramped. But I guess for the location and price, you can't really expect much more.

Beds- These beds are INCREDIBLE. I must admit that although I was excited to be exploring Chicago for the first time, there were moments that I thought about how excited I was to get back to the hotel so I can curl up in the bed. Yes, they were THAT amazing. 3. Location- the location is perfect. it's right in the middle of shopping & dining, and public transportation...we had no problems getting around and catching buses within a block from us. 4.

He did everything but tuck me in at night. Checked in with quite possibly the slowwwest front desk staff on this continent. I have checked in to a hotel in Morroco where no one spoke english and it went smoother. We get to the hotel and got up to the room , small room but thats allright , to find out that apparently the carpet was soaked. I found this out when I kicked off my shoes and stepped on to the soaking carpet. Nice. Had to leave to go to work so down to the painfully slow desk I went. Told the woman working the desk about the carpet and her response was: ""really?"" After a moment of awkward silence I asked if perhaps by chance if she wasn't busy could she wrangle me up a new room. Her response was: 'Hmmmm. Let me see."" Says she can get me a room later and she'll call me when its ready. Got a call several hours later , the new room is ready we'll move your bags , new keys will be waiting at the desk etc... All is well I think , They made a mistake and now are correcting it. Ah yes. Go back to the Felix and the bags haven't been moved , the keys are not ready and now my key to the slop soaked room from earlier will not work. Back down to the desk not once but twice to get everything rectified. The new desk clerk has no idea what is going on and is moving at a pace that makes the first clerk look like Jesse Owens. I started out giving this three stars but have since moved it to one. If you want to see the best thing going at the Felix just walk by and say hi to the doorman. He's the best in the city in my book. the rest of the place? Not so much

The location is absolutely astonishing for a Chicago visit. It's close to the usual assortment of tourist mandated visits but it's also a great location for just getting outside and taking a walk through Downtown Chicago. The Staff is extremely friendly and they really do go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. I mean even the maids greet you in the hallway when they see you.  Meal choices are fair, but expect to pay top dollar to eat, or drink, in the hotel. It's Chicago, get out and eat somewhere else. The parking is extremely over-priced at $50 a night. We opted to rent a car from Enterprise (within walking distance) and turned it in every night for less than $32 a day for a compact car. The gym is placed in an odd location and it looks like it was just put there because the space is probably un-usable for anything else. Nonetheless, a good assortment of ellipticals and treadmills, all with tv's built in. There were also some weight machines and free weights, butfloor space is limited and more than 2 people and you've got a problem. WiFi is not complimentary and I believe it's like $10 a day. I found that rather cheesy, but I paid it anyway out of necessity. The rooms were nice and roomy and mine overlooked the Chicago River and Navy Pier. The wall were however paper thin as one night our next door neighbor received a call from his wife at 2:30am and proceeded to rip into his ass about leaving when their 5 year old child has an ear infection...and she had to work late. Never fret, after 15 minutes he calmed her down and got his mother to come over and help with ""Brandon."" and yes, we heard all that! All in all not a bad place to stay and I'd do it over again.

Now mind you, did get to stay free due to Hilton points, but meh is meh and would've been pissed off if I were paying!  The hotel is based on the older models of Embassy Suites, ie. the prison cell block model where all the rooms are squared around the central atrium look.  On the positive side: Two blocks from Navy Pier and two blocks from Miracle Mile. Walking distance to a few other things too. Grocery store across the street was cool for getting stuff to put in room and a Walgreens a block away. On the negative side: It was crawling with little kiddies of which one we heard crying at night through our room walls (very thin walls I think), the room had no safe or makeup mirror, it had a sink in the bedroom which I thought was rather odd, it took a hella long time for them to bring our bags up after we checked in, they say it takes 20mins to get your car out of valet and for you to call well in advance, OMG you could hear the drunks at the atrium bar at night even with our tv on (the sound just echoed up 10 floors), front desk only had 1-2 people working it at any given time and the concierge was not very helpful or friendly when she was there - which wasn't often, this was the first ES we've been to where they had signs up in the elevators telling you what times breakfast would be more crowded than others, and let me tell you about that!!! Made to order breakfast often had a long line unless you hit it just right and all I saw people get were omelette's and bacon, sausage, and potatoes. Breakfast was THE SAME everyday! Two buffet lines with eggs that looked and tasted like powdered eggs, bacon and sausage links, pancakes, and yogurt. Also watery oatmeal, 3 dried cereals, lots of donuts, and toast and English muffins. One buffet line had food that was always not warm and you only got orange or apple juice as your choices. The managers reception in evening was alright. Cell phone reception was zip in our room and valet parking with in and out privileges was 49$ but self park without in and out was 42$.

Bed was nice, and big enough for 2 or three ;o The only other complaint I had was, our room didn't have a comfy foot rest for the ""red leather deco-chair""...

I lived in Chicago for four years and was thrilled with the location. It is just north of the river - 10 minute walk to Navy Pier, Mag Mile Shopping, and most importantly Gino's East, Frontera, Giordanos, and other great dining spots. It is walkable down to Millennium Park/ Art Institute but allow for a good 20 - 30 minutes. The staff was courteous but not in a robotic manner. Very approachable and if they didn't know the answer, they were happy to look it up. They also demonstrated empathy. Came in on a red eye on a very busy weekend (35K people in Chicago for a conference) and they gave us a room right away at 7am without any fuss.  The rooms were standard for any hotel chain - comfy beds, good tv channel selection, etc. We were fortunate and got a top floor room overlooking the lake and skyscrapers. If there was one thing I would have liked, it would have been complimentary bottle water to take on the road or to make coffee with in the morning - only because Chicago tap water has a slightly chlorinated taste to it. Also, the bottles of conditioner and shampoo were on the smaller side - enough for me but my wife needed more. I LOVED the fact they didn't charge for WiFi nor for use of the business center to print boarding tickets, maps, etc. On another occasion, I ate at Viand and it isn't bad - seems to be a popular function spot. (At the same time though, there are plenty of other great restaurants within close walking distance).

We requested a room that faced Ontario street like our guidebook suggested, and we got a corner room facing ontario street (windows on two walls) which was great.

The only two things that would have made it perfect would have been coffee makers in the rooms (there is a horrible complimentary coffee machine in the lobby, which was broken half the time) and a business center where we could check our email or bank accounts online.

And I'm sure they were traveling with their spouses & needed a King bed. They didn't even have any queens & were very rude about the whole checking in process. Like I was doing them a favor by coming there. The rooms were clean, but besides being close to good food that's all the positive I have to say about it.

The girlfriend tasked me with planning a date where we got all dressed up all fancy and such. Yelp led me here and as always it did not disappoint. Check-in and check-out were relatively quick and hassle free. One thing I really liked about this place is the fact that they have done everything to retain the old world looks (we got actual keys for our room!) The doors were either original or very reproductions, I loved the hinges on them. The accents throughout the building and our room reflect the exterior of the building and its charm. While marble stairs worn from years of use, just awesome. I also loved the phone they had in the hallway styled to look old world. If you have a chance you might want to visit the Atwood Cafe, after a night out we decided to stop by and get some drinks. They dont skimp on the alcohol and we struck up a good conversation with the bartender (he previously worked at the place we went for dinner that night). Funny story, on our way back up in the elevator from the Atwood Cafe we ended up sharing the elevator with a member of the hotels management, he asked me to hit floor 11... I asked him for one of the bottles of Chianti he had hands full of. He was quick to inform me.... ""ask and ye shall receive"", that simple gesture made our night even better. We had a good laugh over it and enjoyed the bottle later. Great way to end a good night on the town. Great place to stay, the management is helpful and the amenities are generous. OH! And I forgot to add, we stayed in room 1503, its as high as you can go and has great views of State and Washington, see for yourself from my pictures.

It has all of the amenities of a first-class hotel and very friendly and kind staff. I just feel great staying at the Drake. This is a great place to come for those looking to spend a fun weekend in the city. Never pretentious and always timeless, the Drake is the best place in Chicago to hide out from the and bustle of city life while still having access to all of the great things this city offers. I especially like the interior decoration and the suites with a lake-view. In comparison with similar European luxury hotels, the Drake really is not too expensive. So I really do hope you treat yourself and someone special to this fine Chicago institution.

Stupid Chicago rule... Anywho, we also had drinks in the pub downstairs and I believe I had the best martini in my life. It is called a Castle Wrecker and you must try it--hints of raspberry, peach, and lime :) What I really liked about this place is that we are very young looking for our age and we were never discriminated for that.

Since I was sharing a room with a colleague, this was super-helpful and much appreciated! - Ornate and often very classy decor. *Definitely* not the bland, sterile Hilton's I've been accustomed to elsewhere. - Free calls to 800 numbers. A small respite from their cheap-ass nickel-and-diming I mention below. - Friendly and helpful employees. - Decent location, at least in that it's near the Shedd Aquarium and planetarium and so on. But I wouldn't call it centrally located. BAD: - One morning, I had only lukewarm water in the shower :(. - They seem to wash towels whether you want them to or not. That's wasteful. - Don't bother with their restaurant, Pavillion. Very mediocre food (at best). Fruits: hard as a rock and flavorless. Prawn salad = four tasty prawns on top of unsurprisingly wilted greens that are sitting in about a 2 inch-deep mixture of orange juice and water (well, that's what the dressing tasted like). Lobster bisque soup: Where's The Beef? Er, I mean lobster. Even the bisque part wasn't very tasty. In short, yuck! - As with nearly all Hiltons, it seems, you get nickeled and dimed. They charge you $1.50 per bag checked in their storage, for crying out loud. That's a complimentary service at *every* other hotel I've stayed at. And $15/day for wireless? $25 for late checkout? $6 for the unfrigerated bottle of water on your desk?!  - Assuming it's the Hilton that caters conference lunches... YUCK!!! Could they not have varied the sandwich choice once in five days?! Or offered a sandwich that didn't taste like eating flavorless sawdust? - Christmas music. 24/7 in the lobbies. Not even very good Christmas music, mind you... just schmaltzy crap on and on and on... - Beds were too soft to be comfortable. * * * I was conflicted between 2 and 3 stars here. I'd say 2.5, but decided on 2 due to the crappy dining options in the hotel and the nickel-and-diming (admittedly typical in most high-end hotels, but that doesn't make it right).

Because of it's uniqueness, beauty, and proximity to the Shedd Aquarium, we selected the Palmer House for our wedding weekend room block. I had been to the Palmer House for fabulous and fun events before, but never before stayed there. The special events staff is very easy to work with and quick to reply to emails. It seemed like our event kept changing hands, but that everyone seemed to know what was going on. We kept adding guests after our rate had supposedly ended, and they did it without fuss. One of those rooms was a room for me for Friday night, a reservation which I made myself with the special events manager. First impressions arriving were pretty good. If you are not valeting a car (which is really expensive) that needs to stand for about 10 minutes while you unload, I would highly recommend entering on the Monroe and NOT the Wabash side. The L passing overhead on Wabash is deafening. The porters brought out two carts to carry our suitcases and 6 dresses (for my mom, sister, and I for the rehearsal and the wedding). They told us to check in and get comfortable and they would bring it right up. They did, which was great service. Now when my sister and I got to the room, I was shocked to see how tiny it was.This was one of the older, not rehabbed rooms. I mean, I know it's an old hotel, but still! I was calling as the bride for a 60-room wedding block and that was the best they had? I ended up hanging my dress from the air conditioning vent because the closet wasn't big enough for it, and we had to move it over like a curtain to exit the room. In terms of sleeping, I thought that the mattress in the room was too soft. You may think I was being a princess on the room size, but I definitely was not. The next morning, my sister/maid of honor forced me to ""sleep in"" (awoke at 5:30am -- sleep fail), and then she ordered us room service. When the server arrived, he said, ""Good morning -- wow, this is a small room!"" THAT's how you know it's a small room -- when the man who has probably seen half the hotel and who is probably coached on making you feel like a welcomed guest comments on it! Anyway, the deluxe oatmeal my sister got us was very good.  That afternoon, we checked into a suite. Wooooooooohooooo! Talk about an upgrade! For about twice the price, we got five times the space: two bathrooms, a master bedroom, a dining room, a full desk, a living room/TV space, and a half kitchen. It was completely redone, as was the entire 10th floor. It was the perfect space to cyclone through before your big day -- shoes all over the floor, flower boxes, bobby pins flying everywhere. That suite could handle it. I slept like a rock in there. The regular rooms being cleaned that I peeked into while going down the hallways also looked very nice. If you have the cash or are willing to splurge for a special occasion, I say do it! The rich, ornate lobby and city streets that surround the Palmer House are gorgeous and perfect for touring, entertainment, and for photography. The lobby bar serves some very good drinks, including a seriously decked-out Bloody Mary. One thing about the lobby bar though -- the bartenders were pretty creepy to me. Another friend described them as total jerks. We had reserved a separate suite for the wedding after-party, and that purpose was expressly communicated to the Palmer House. The hotel failed to move one very ornery guest next door to the suite who was complaining at 4pm about noise coming from the suite when 6 friends were watching a football game. So we knew there was going to be trouble later. Sure enough, at 1:00am when our guests come back, there's a knock on the door. 3 hotel staff tell us we have to stop. My husband flatly and loudly tells them that that's not a solution we'll accept because they knew the purpose of the room and they knew this guest who was complaining was a problem earlier. I also reminded them about the business we're driving to the hotel. Eventually, one of the staff persons gets the brilliant idea to take us down to one of the party/conference rooms on the lower level of the hotel. Way to problem solve! We pick up all the champagne and music and follow him, and the party merrily continued on until 5:30am (sans me and Alex). The next morning, we had a nice farewell breakfast at the hotel. I would avoid anything on biscuits -- they were too buttery or something. The texture was off. We continued to lounge around in the hotel lobby with friends and family for about 2 hours after we checked out without hassle. Friends of ours who were staying in Chicago for several days but had checked out of the Palmer House that morning were able to leave their bags with the front desk for at least 24 hours.

Today was my first time staying at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago and when the taxi pulled up to the entrance, I must say I was unimpressed....it looks very old and dated. Once I walked through the doors however, I was so pleased! It's very modern and updated inside. There's a beautiful fountain in the entrance that a bistro/bar overlooks. There's also a 2nd floor bar that overlooks this same fountain. I make my way up the escalators to the 2nd floor check in and was greeted by Jason Dennard at the check in counter. He was so pleasant and accomodating. He took the time to ask where I was coming in from, how was my day, etc. He asked my prefernce for a room, ie; king or 2 queens...I respond by saying 'king'....he looks for the room options and informs me that the only available king room is by the elevator - in which he suggested I don't take that room. I really appreciated him telling me this, particularly after reading some of the other reviews regarding noise.  I make my way to the west tower to go to my room. There's a west and east tower - this place is huge, but everything is well marked and easily walkable. I decide to forgo a night on the town and order room service - the menu offers all the basics - nothing too fancy unless you choose to order from Stetson's (their in-house Steak House) but expect to pay $34 for a filet or $30 for the salmon. Instead, I opt for the vegetarian wrap, tomato soup, and a glass of Oregon pinot gris. Either I was really hungry, or this was the best 'room service' meal I've ever had. It was so fresh - the wrap had asparagus, red pepper, eggplant, zuchini, and a white bean puree to hold it all together. I honestly wasn't expecting much, and this far exceeded my expectations.  The rooms are comfortable with modern decor. I would definitely stay here again.

Good customer service from the desk and door staff (I know it is their job, but they handled it well-- including hailing cabs and making sure we had umbrellas during downpours).

I got gangsta treatment from the guy (wearing the name tag ""Ken"") at the reception who banged pens and key cards at the desk, was staring at me and generally giving the attitude that he wanted to jump across the counter and grab my neck, and came close to mouthing obscenities and tried big time intimidation by staring.

The website for this hotel was so gorgeous that my friends came expecting to be awed...instead what I got was probably the worst room in the entire hotel. It was the size of my college dorm room, the bathroom can be more or less described as an 'efficiency' and my view (way up high on the 10th floor)...brace yourself...was of a parking lot across the street. What made it worse was that it was 2 steps from the elevator so all I heard during the night were the dings of people going up and down. Which brings me up to my next point...I had 2 friends over to watch tv for a few hours before going out and management called my room 4 times to complain about the 'noise level'. At one point they said 'we are going to have to ask you to leave if this keeps up' ...not a great thing to say to a guest? especially when that guest has to listen to the elevator all night. In summary, this hotel should not be considered a 4 star. I've stayed at holiday inns that were much more quiet, considerate and BIGGER. Maybe they just like to yank my chain because I bought it off of priceline but at this price point, I would've been better off putting up an extra 50 to be pampered, not insulted.

About a month or two after my dad booked the hotel, he got a call that there was fraudulent activity on the credit card he used to reserve the rooms (even though they were already paid for). My dad canceled that account and alerted the hotel of this in advance, and then when we checked in, he offered to put another credit card on file and the front desk said that wouldn't be a problem. My extended family decided to stay in town for an extra 2 nights, and in advance my dad asked to extend the reservation. He repeatedly went to the front desk to ask if they needed a credit card on file and if they needed to transfer the room into my aunt and uncle's name. The front desk said that would be no problem. When my father checked out, he again confirmed that my family would be staying in the second room and if everything was okay, and the people at the front desk again said no problem.After my family arrived back in New Orleans, they had hysterical voicemails from my aunt because she was locked out of the room. The front desk said the rooms weren't paid for or reserved, so instead of contacting my aunt or my dad -- or even bothering to leave a note on their door, where all of there stuff was -- they just locked my family out. My dad was on the phone for nearly 2 hours between my frantic aunt and the hotel management who blamed my dad for the miscommunication, despite the fact my dad asked the front desk SEVERAL TIMES if the room was reserved for an extended stay and if they needed info on file (turns out, the morons at the front desk never bothered to write anything down). When everything was finally worked out, my dad asked for the hotel to comp him part of the rate for all of the headache and aggravation he went through and for locking my family out of their room without a notice and they said THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. Um, bull.My dad held his ground and said that it was ridiculous that because of their negligence we had to go through all of this, so they finally gave my aunt 50% off their last 2 nights and 3 breakfast coupons. Took a few hours to get that.Everyone understand that people make mistakes, but the hotel failed by not only refusing to acknowledge that they made one, but then they tried to blame my dad for it instead of own up to the mistake and simply fixing it.I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND STAYING AT THIS HOTEL!

I didn't mind that the room may have been on the small side as some other guests mentioned on here. If I had paid the full rate I may have been more irked...but we were only there to sleep so not a big deal at all. We stayed in the Executive levels of the hotel..not sure if that makes any difference whatsoever in the rooms. Sore points: They charge for EVERYTHING. Parking, gym use, internet...don't open that bottle of water they leave out...it's not free. They even charged me $1.50 to make a local call. I don't mind nominal fees, but $43 a night for parking, $15 per day of internet use....adds up quick.  We were afraid to touch the complimentary coffee or turn on the lights for fear of hidden charges! They also sell jewelry in the lobby which I thought was kind of tacky. I'll leave on a positive note because despite my griping, it's not a bad hotel: The rooms were comfortable and guest services were helpful and efficient. The soaps/shampoos were Crabtree and Evelyn which I love. This is a business class hotel, not a luxury hotel...so if you're expecting the royal treatment it's probably not going to happen. If you can get a great deal through priceline, hotwire etc to offset the cost of parking, go for it!

I am the one who picked the W in the first place, so I'll take the blame. It looks so plush and stylish in the photos. The first thing we noticed when walking in (besides Billy Zane getting into a limo... now I know it was an omen) was a club atmosphere in the lobby. There were lots of martini drinkers sitting around in sunglasses... The receptionists were too trendy for their own good, and I suspect that the one on the right was faking his English accent. (Oh yeah, they actually tell you to ""take the lift"" here...) In my opinion, it always is a mistake for a hotel staff to come off as condescending, and here, they definitely did. (There are plenty of high-end hotels who operate with friendliness.) We reserved a room with two queen beds, since my sister-in-law was joining us for a couple of days. We got off the elevator (which was scented, a nice touch) and, despite it being full daylight outside, were plunged into club-style darkness. The halls are very dark, with colored lights to guide your walk. When we opened our door, a lot of light was coming in from the big window. (We were on the west side of the hotel, so we had a crappy view of the building next door.) Ambient club music was playing from the small CD alarm clock, and the room looked really clean. Another look, and I realized there were Ws on everything... everything. My God, the room was one big marketing campaign and attempt to sell merchandise (including a $22 bottle of water that had been picked up and passed over so many times the logo had worn off). It was highly annoying to me. I started obsessing about finding everything that was W-branded -- and my finds included a teddy bear, the CD of music playing when we came in, coffee mugs, t-shirts -- and started seeing a lot of wear-and-tear on the room and furniture. Actually, it reminded me a lot of Design on a Dime... like it might look good to last through the photo/filming session, then all the cheap Scandinavian-style laminate furniture and other cost-cutting features start to fall apart and reveal the hotel for what it really is: the illusion of luxury and exclusivity. The most annoying thing, though, was the ""divider"" (yes, I said divider) between the bathroom and rest of the room. There was no solid, latching door, just a woven sliding panel that made comfortable privacy impossible. To boot, the panel in our room was BROKEN, so there was a hole in it. Also, there is a shuttered pass-through between the bathroom and bed area that doesn't fully close off any view or sound. I understand the concept (you can be in bed AND watch your lover take a shower... although the shower curtain was opaque, so I'm not sure what else you could watch), but when a room has two beds, there should be some consideration that lovers might not constitute a full party staying in a room. Not be be crass, but... there's this book called Everyone Poops. I think the W got confused and thought it was called Everyone Needs to Know When Everyone Poops. I give two stars for the beds being comfortable and room service (when requesting towels) being very prompt. Plus, we didn't get robbed... except for our dignity.

We had a room facing the inner courtyard, so noise from the L was not a problem. The room was huge with a bathroom that was twice the size of a college dorm room. It even had a jacuzzi bath tub seperate from the shower. The location is perfect for traveling by train. It is a short walk from Union Station. It is also a short walk to the art institute, Grant Park, shopping, theaters, and restaurants. Ada's (the restaruant on the ground floor of the hotel) provides a quick and easy choice for breakfast or lunch. There is an L station around the corner, making it easy to get around the city day or night. I only have two complaints, both of which would not prevent me from returning. First, the room was a little warm our first day and night there. The rooms have an automatic system which turns off 30 minutes after leaving the room. I think we figured out a way to make it stay on just until the room temperature was better. Second, we wanted to watch a movie and relax but were deterred by the $14,95 charge for the movies. I might have paid 7-10, but $15 for a movie was a little unreasonable. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel, although I like the http://hotels.com price for much better than their standard room rates.

I'd recommend this place for any tourist. There's a Walgreens nearby as well as a liquor shop (since a lot of restaurants are BYOB). Tons of great stuff nearby!

Our bamboo blinds were broken so the middle one didn't go up all the way and we had a lamp that was on when we came in the room, but that the switch was broken off of, so the only way we could figure to turn it off was to actually unplug the light bulb. Not ideal. Also I'm not that big of a fan of the rain shower head if it is only used in order to disguise low-ish water pressure, which I had the impression was the case at this W. Under the rain shower head = warm goodness. Everywhere else in the shower stall = BRRRR. My legs were less than thrilled that I had to actually hold them under the water while shaving them because any other action would have been a direct trip to Goose Bump City. Also the walls were really thin. While getting ready for the wedding we went to Sunday night, we could hear every word coming out of the television next door. As though it was in our room (and I don't even think that our neighbors had it turned up past normal volume). Anyway, W, if you are listening, maybe put some money into making the rooms more like new again. The rooms are good-sized and the location and views are top-notch. Easy fixes, I say. Until then, W Downtown might be a better bet. Or if you are feeling silly spendy (or have the ole expense account working for you), stay at one of my all time faves, Park Hyatt Water Tower. Sigh.

Yes, the rooms are small, but they are efficient. I have stayed in much smaller rooms. The room didn't feel cramped at all. We booked a room in the River Hotel(floors 3-10) but we got a room in the Club Quarters(11 and up). Since it was as described, I imagine it was the same accommodations I could expect from the River Hotel, just with a better view. Everyone we spoke to was very nice, and accommodating. There is no Iron in the room, but there is one available on one of the other floors. There are water bottles available that you can fill up, which was fantastic. We ended up getting them for my parents too, because water at their hotel was $8. We didn't get a chance to eat in the restaurant, but it looked very nice, and is highly rated. The outdoor tables are super cute. I think the best thing about this hotel though is the location. It's right on the Chicago River near Michigan Avenue. There is so much that is within walking distance. It is also super close to L stops. The closest one is State/Lake, which has the Red line, and a couple others. A block up at Clark/Lake is the Blue Line that will take you to/from O'Hare. It's easy walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, State St, the Art Institute. There are also easy buses to Lincoln Park Zoo and Navy Pier. There is a Corner Bakery Cafe located right next door too for a cheap, good breakfast, or a lite snack. I also felt very safe at this hotel, after midnight you have to be buzzed in, you also have to use your key to access the Elevator. Apparently this is a Historic Building also. At one time, briefly, it was the tallest Building in Chicago, it is also considering the skinniest Sky Scraper in Chicago. It's a beautiful building! If you are someone who is looking for a small, nice, efficient room close to everything, this place is perfect for you. If you are looking for a big, luxurious room with all sorts of amenities, this place probably isn't for you. Considering its about $75 less a night than most of the surrounding hotels though, it's a fantastic deal! I would definitely stay here again.

Very convenient location. Shops, bars, restaurants are all within walking distance. Taxis came quickly. Service was friendly and helpful.  The rooms were decent; bathroooms were a little smaller than I would have liked (hey, I was sharing with another woman!).  The fact that they had a real, full-on Starbucks in the lobby was a HUGE plus. To me, nothing is worse than having to attend day after day of a grueling national sales meeting with bad coffee. Every day started off right here!!! A bar being in the center of the lobby meant you were never far away from a cocktail the second work was done, either.  I haven't stayed anywhere else in downtown Chicago so I don't have much to compare it to in the city but it was a great location at a decent price for a big city.

For some reason, I keep booking room in boutique hotels thinking that they'll have a chip on their shoulder to really try to impress their customers. This, however, has not been my experience. We were in Chicago on business and needed to use the printer in the business center. I called ahead before we even booked and asked about their business center. They assured me that they had building-wide wifi as well as a printer that guests could use. When we arrived, I attempted to print 4 sheets of paper for an upcoming meeting. The page was streaked. Printer read: Change Black Ink. So I called down, thinking it would be no big deal, and they happily said they would send someone up. Okay. I left for the meeting and went about my day. The next day I went down to the business center and the printer was doing the same thing. They never changed the cartridge. I called the front desk and they assured me again that they would send someone up. 2 hours later, nothing had changed. I called again and they said I could use the front desk's printer. I went down and they very nicely printed off about 15 pages for me (though it was odd that the guy at the desk wanted to log into my email account himself... ""okay, what's your password.""  Umm, no. The next day I went down to the business center to print our boarding passes -- three guys in suits are in there complaining about how the printer is streaking and says it needs a new cartridge. Ridiculous. The wifi in the building is a joke. I was on the 6th floor and couldn't get a signal. If you're on the 4th floor (where the business center is), then you might get one, so request that floor. They had to send up an ethernet cable for me to connect to the internet. Finally, the breakfast was lame. I understand you want to be able to advertise ""free breakfast,"" but the food was generally stale, especially the bagels. It was nice to have free coffee, so I can't complain about it that much since I'm not big on breakfast. If you are expecting even the equivalent of a Hampton Inn, you'll be dismayed. Despite this, the rooms were pretty nice and I have no complaints there. If you're here for business, I can't recommend Amalfi. ""Meh. I've experienced better"" pretty much sums up my experience at Amalfi.

We checked in pretty late at night, the person at the front desk was a lady, she was ok but either did not understand my question or did not want to answer it. I asked the lady for a room with a view, and she said, ""here are your keys, your room faces south."" I asked again, ""does it have a nice view."" Her response: ""it faces south."" UM OK? By the way, it did not have a nice view. All I saw was the building in front of me, which was all glass. I thought maybe our window was the kind of glass where we could look out, but no one could look in. No, I was wrong. I could see myself in the glass window of the building across from us. The bed was comfortable and the room was pretty clean. The next morning, I had to print something for a conference, so I went to the business center, and the internet was (I think) about $6 for 15 minutes. They REALLY should NOT be charging to use internet in the business center. I understand if you charge for internet in the rooms, but really?? The internet was SO SLOW. It took 15 minutes to load http://gmail.com and open a one-page word document. I called the guy in-charge of this, his name was ""Eddie."" He was unapologetic and said ""people use this all the time."" Then he swiped his card on the other computer and asked me to use it, again same thing. It was SO SLOW and did not load. Eddie still did not apologize or anything. I looked for a fedex closeby and found one in the Marriott. It worked flawlessly. The next thing to happen was that my room key did not work. The REALLY RUDE woman at the front desk said, ""if you keep the key near your phone, it deactivates."" Well, I did not keep it near the phone, so I don't know why it deactivated. Also, there were two other people in line whose keys also were deactivated. Third bad thing: the showers are difficult to figure out. Seriously? You need instructions for the showers. All in all, not worth the price and I am definitely not going back and not recommending it to anyone else. You can get better service and experience in another hotel for sure.

Cheap motels, budget hotels, sketchy inns you name it I've stayed in them even. So when I stayed here with two friends on a recent trip to Chicago, I was blown away by everything this hotel offered. It was close to a lot of the major attractions, perfectly located on a quiet street not far from public transit stops and just a few blocks from the bars and clubs.  And the room was by no means a let down. Our reservation was originally for a single queen after a little Travelocity snafu. (When booking through a third party you will sometimes be given the next available room if the one you want is unavailable. We booked a double but got stuck with a single.) Desperate and unwilling to share a bed with the two of them, I asked the man at the front desk if they had any other doubles available. Fortunately for me they had one available and he was nice enough to give it to us. It wasn't the biggest room, but the bathroom was decently sized and the beds were amazingly comfortable--so comfortable that the three of us slept through our alarms every morning. The bathroom was one of the best parts of the room, second only to the beds. It had one of those awesome shower heads that makes it feel like it's raining and there was never a towel shortage. And of course, it came fully stocked with bathroom essentials--soap, shampoo and conditioner that delightfully smelled like the lobby, and q-tips & cotton balls.  As if things couldn't get any better, the staff was amazing. Chuck the doorman was super friendly and knew everything there was to know about the city from which bars and restaurants to hit, to the most efficient route to get from one point to the next complete with directions so detailed that they included which set of stairs to take. Even the late night staff was so helpful as to help my friend carry me back to the room after having a little to much fun our last night in town.

You'd think the cabbies would get the hang of it since they probably drop people off all the time, but the valets/parking director guys had to constantly redirect people who pulled in the wrong way. I'm sure this gets very frustrating for them...in fact it's quite obvious it does, because the valets tend to yell at everyone who drives in. Hopefully not at guests pulling in, but I only experienced it with the two or three cab rides we took back to the hotel. 2) The girl who checked us in was pretty rude.  3) It WAS pretty obvious upon entering our room that it had been remodeled from a significantly crappier room...the popcorn ceiling was still there. Also there wasn't a lot of room for storage. 4) $52/night parking?!?! But after that initial impression, things were looking up.  1) I loved the ""Good Morning/Good Afternoon/Good Evening"" mats they diligently changed out in the elevators every day.  2) I loved the view and location.  3) I loved the gym (and the view from the gym!) And the apples. 4) I loved the stealhy ninja cleaning ladies who managed to find windows to get our room nice and tidy even if we were only gone for like 30 minutes.  5) I loved the Bliss bath products 6) I ESPECIALLY loved the concierge who helped us when we had a medical emergency late Sunday night. I never did get his name but he had longish curly hair and made it a priority to ensure that we were taken care of. He got us in touch with medical staff on call, and when even they couldn't help us, he called around to get us an emergency appointment first thing the next morning. He was a lifesaver!!! Yes, it got a little crowded and loud in the lobby/bar/restaurant in the evenings, but it didn't bother us at all. I was bummed that I don't get SPG points if I book through Priceline, but I got a waaaaay better rate that way so I guess it worked out. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

There is a lot about the hotel that is good -- even wonderful. But there are also some downsides. The front desk, concierge, and bell staff are phenomenal. They are friendly, attentive, and move the seemingly endless lines very quickly. They are that same combination of assertive and nice that characterizes most Chicagoans, and they remind me why I fell in love with Chicago in the first place so long ago. The maid staff falls into this category as well, when you run into them, and everyone of these people deserve a hefty tip and a round of applause. The lobby showcases Rush bar, a rushed place that is constantly packed with patrons and guests of the hotel, and the staff flurries about as quickly as possible, slinging overpriced drinks while holding a terse smile and their breath. I can't blame them for their stress, but they need a few extra helpers on hand. The rooms are basic but nice. No flat screens or iPod docks to be found, but the beds are comfortable, and the blankets are plentiful. I asked to be on an upper floor and was given a room on the 39th, with a lake view, which was lovely. However, the windows either don't seal well or are too thin, because it seems there is no sound dampening at all between you and the Magnificently loud Mile at your feet. The detractions I have for the hotel are more on the conference side. The food, while pricey, is supremely bland. I had salmon one night, chicken the next, and a vegetarian dish the following, and they all tasted exactly the same. I found this disturbing, to say the least. In addition, the conference rooms are freezing. When you are sitting on your duff for 8 to 9 hours a day, your circulation needs a bit of help from the temp gauges, and these rooms do not afford it. Bring a coat. Better yet, bring a sleeping bag. I would stay here again, but I would not plan another event here. I recommend it for a pleasure trip to the city. The location can't be beat, and the surrounding shops, restaurants, and walkable places are worth every dime.

Every hotel I have stayed at downtown charged at least $35 a night, so they aren't out of line. I stopped by a few self parks near by, and there was almost no savings, so I just valeted every night. Plus you get in and out. Elevators: Either they changed this problem, or other people stayed at a different hotel then I did. It was a concern of mine after reading the reviews so I made sure to time them. The longest wait I had was 45 seconds. They had 4 elevators 2 serving the first half and 2 serving the other. It worked well. Rooms: Mine I believe was an older one. It was still clean, fairly updated, and without any complaints. My view was of some surrounding buildings and a bit of Michigan Ave, but I didn't care. The location is stellar (within a short walk to every el line in the city), and the price is right.

I'm a points whore so doing a ""mattress run"" is a no brainer for me. Hotel is located in the southwest portion of the loop, directly across from the Quincy CTA station. I arrived at 11 AM and noticed the lobby has been renovated. It's eclectic modern. Oversized lamps and an s curve sofa make up the main area of the ""living room"".  I walk thru the living room and over to the pods which are located in front of the elevators and I'm greeted warmly by not just one, but two staff members. Since it was so early I was going to ask if my luggage could be stored until check-in time and ill go out and do some other things. They tell me no problem and as a returning guest they've assigned me a nice suite. Surprisingly I was told my room was ready. The property recognizes my Elite status, asks if I need a late checkout and inquires if I need my receipt emailed to me after check out.. Little things like this go a long way.  I go around the corner and enter what I describe as the vertigo elevators of death. If you look at that mural for too long, you'll be sure to earl. I walk into my room to find I've been upgraded to a room I'd previously been assigned. The room has been renovation the wall and door that separated the parlor from bedroom have been removed. There is now one central wall that houses a flat screen TV for each ""room"" When you enter the room, there is a powder room on the right and closet on the left. As soon as you pass thru the entry you're in the parlor portion of the room. There is a wet bar are and a half wall with a TV above and a desk below. The desk is nice and very practical but with only a few sockets. The furniture on the parlor side of the room is a bit tacky and its like the hotel was trying to hard to be eclectic. It's just didn't do anything for me. The sofa is hideous! Passing thru to the bedroom side of the room, the decor is much better, now this what I think a W should ""look"" like. The W Bed is totally inviting. On the wall is 40 HD TV that is identical to the TV in the parlor. Due to the location there is not much of a view, but the room does offer a view of the Quincy CTA Station, which is perfect for train spotters. I thought being close to the train might cause some noise, but I didnt hear a peep Off the bedroom is a hallway that houses a closet and leads you to the bathroom. The bathroom is rather awkward. Walking into the bathroom, on the left near the door is the sink and to the right is the toilet and tub/shower. Disappointing that the room doesn't have a double vanity and that there is no separate shower. The sink is pretty small and does not leave much space to spread out. Two people cannot use the sink area at once. In addition, I got water everywhere. The room doesn't have a shower only a tub, but it's got some nice hardware and good water pressure. The bathroom is stocked with the typical Bliss sink side six pack of toiletries. Sweat has nice equipment, cardio machines and free weights, but there is no pool. Some additional information: There is a small business center on the mid mezzanine level. High speed internet available for free in the lobby and its $14.95 in room and the hotel offers Acura service within five miles of the hotel. At checkout on of the associates I'm familiar with said, ""you're one of my favorite guest. You're so funny. You've got to stay with us for more than just one night the next time you come."" FINAL IMPRESSION If you'd like a good hotel while in Chicago this is the place for you. Just know that on weekends there isn't much around the hotel, so you'll need to travel outside of the loop for dining and entertainment options. The overall staff attitude has greatly improved. They appeared to be appreciative of being employed and more than willing to help.  After checkout, I had a small billing issue (this is why I always request that my folio be emailed) where 36 dollars of items from the mini bar was charged to my folio. When I called about this, it took a minute to remove, the staff apologized and I wasn't made to feel like a liar. Good recovery and follow-up was good.  I would return to this hotel based on price and time of year, in the winter months i would prefer to be closer to Michigan Avenue. It's a nice hotel for a business or leisure traveler, but better suited for the business traveler based on the location.

Here's the skinny, if you're hoping to run into a washed up rock star (CeCe Deville for us, and no the teenagers had no idea who he was) you may want to spend your hard earned money here. I took my younger sister and a couple of her friends (teenagers) for an overnighter in Chicago on our way to Wisconsin. I chose the Hard Rock for the ambiance. I mean come on it is supposed to be ""COOL"". Well it wasn't. The Positives: *It is in the Carbon & Carbide Building, which is beautiful. *The location: it sits in the middle of everything *The lobby has two computers for guest use. *The fitness center is very nice. Cardio machines have individual TV's and there are head phones in case you forgot yours. They have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack. *Check-in and out was quick and Valet was very courteous. The Negatives: *The rooms were small and ours wasn't clean (pistachio shells on the floor). The rooms were painted purplish gray (we were on the Prince floor) with a picture of Bob Marley hanging on one of the walls. The girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows. *Bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub. *The cable reception was poor; I kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture. *It isn't anywhere near the Hard Rock Caf. *There was very little memorabilia. *There is no pool, and yes I knew this when I made the reservation. To wrap it up, I won't be staying here again. If I am going to drop almost 4 Benjamins on a hotel room, I will stay at the Palmer House Hilton. But that is a whole different review.

I have to say that the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. The decorating is almost eerie and Alice in Wonderland-esque. Definitely strange at times (we had one ceramic white roller skate in our suite) but we found it more entertaining that anything else. The food in the lounge was great. They had free coffee all hours of the day, and I ordered a waffle that was delicious. I wouldn't recommend eating or drinking anything out of the room since the prices on snacks are so inflated. Our suite was really nice. We had a separate living room with two couches, a dining room table and a large flat screen TV. There were closets everywhere. Two large full bathrooms which had awesome Bliss Spa toiletries. The bedroom was large with a King size bed, a really cozy down comforter and another flat screen TV. The only negative to the room was that the lighting was very dim (along with the rest of the hotel) so when it came time to do hair and make-up we called concierge for more lamps. And living up to their ""wherever, whenever"" motto, they brought up 4 table lamps in a jiffy! Overall I think this hotel was perfect for our wedding stay. Mainly because it was so close to our venue, but also because it was clean, comfortable, and the staff was very accommodating.

I struggled between a 3 & 4 star because I expected more since it was ""The Drake"" but overall my stay was fine. Although it does have the historic charm, the location is great and the service was ok overall, there were little things that I didn't particularly care for which is why I gave it a 3 star rating. If I could, I would of given it a 3.5 star rating. 1. When we first checked in, they gave us a room that was not made. The bed looked like someone had laid on top of it, there was garbage in the trash can etc. I went downstairs and they changed my room but I didn't like that the person from the front desk went to the back office to check to make sure that the room really wasn't made. 2. I assume the elevators are still from the 1920's because they move incredibly slow. Doesn't sound like a big deal but when you have to wait several elevators (they are full from so many people waiting) in order to finally get in one during peak times (ie. check out time etc.) it's a little annoying.  3. It was pretty warm when we were there and we wanted to get ice. Well the ice machine on our floor was broken. When I flagged down someone that worked there to tell him, he said that I'd have to go to a different floor and try the machines there. I would think being a high end hotel, I expected him to have offered to get some for us but I guess I was expecting too much. 4. The room itself was ok although I thought the carpet needed to be changed. It looked really used and worn in and definitely needs to be updated. The bed was comfortable though which is a big plus in my book. One of the good things about the hotel was the gym. The gym had just been remodeled and it's very nice. There are some cardio and weight machines. There is also a section that had free weights too and there are flat screen tv's there too. Overall I wouldn't mind staying at the Drake again but I don't think I'd go out of my way to stay there again.

I also enjoyed the free hot chocolate that they would serve in the mornings and evenings at the lobby. Seeing the marshmallows and chocolate bits melt into my hot chocolate made me giddy. Hehe. :) Another great plus, is the LOCATION. Right on Magnificent Mile where all the good shopping and good food take place. :) I think the only complaint I have are the tiny and slow elevators that don't even have sensors. They only stay open for a few seconds, then afterwards, it'll just smoosh you as you're getting in. Although, I WAS in the elevator with Michael Phelps. So that was cool. I swear, that was him.

Location: As written in other reviews the hotel is located right by a freeway on the boarder of Greek-town. I personally found it convenient since I cabbed all of my nightly excursions. I was able to get to where I wanted to be quickly and cheaply by avoiding street lights. The CP Metro has two bus stops that can connect you with the major transfer hubs for both buses and trains. As mentioned in previous reviews there is a full service supermarket named Dominick's across the street from the main entrance. Behind the hotel you can find a Walgreen's, Starbucks and various eateries which are open until the wee hours of the morning. Hotel : From the outside the CP metro looks very outdated but don't judge just yet. The inside has been fully remodeled in a very sleek and modern motif. It modern with a splash of Miami. The hotel offers king and double rooms most with small balcony. I had a great room facing the Sears Tower. A business center, and fitness center are also offered. The CP Metro has a full service restaurant and bar located on the ground floor named Retro . A 1940's American Eatery and Martini Bar offering American classics with a contemporary flair. Room: All rooms are fully carpeted tiled and offer a flat panel television, mini fridge and free Wi-Fi ( it was rather slow so I used the cable connection instead). The bathrooms were average in size and offered a pocket door instead of a standard one. Beds were comfortable. Overall the room was very clean. The staff I encountered were courteous, friendly and accommodating. I arrived early and they held my bags I also requested a double room because I had previously requested a king. Everyone was really nice and I got no attitudes at all. Hotel tends to be busy on weekdays since it host various company meetings and trainings. During my stay folks from United Airlines were there for a training seminar. Within Walking Distance Walgreen's 24 Hour Pharmacy, Starbucks, Sears Tower , United Center, and Harpo Studios

But the front desk staff was excellent. The carpet in the room needs replacing badly. There were iron burns on it and it was filthy. The room was very noisy as we were on the same level as the elevated train, which corners by every 6 minutes. The room was large but most of the space was wasted due to a terrible layout that put one of the beds blocking the entry to the bathroom. The bathroom was nice but there was literally no surface space other than the floor to put anything. They put the tissues on the desk because there is nowhere to fit it in the bathroom. Strangely, the bathroom is quite large and would have plenty of space for shelves. If you are looking for a bargain, this is your place, but if you have the money, I would recommend staying somewhere else.

I did like that they were willing to call me when they had a room available since I checked in early. I thought I was supposed to be in a pinnacle king (which i booked on http://Hotels.com) and mentioned this to the lady who checked me in. She told me ""yeah, you're in a superior king"" Only after I had unpacked all my stuff did I realize that there WAS a difference ( I thought maybe there were two names for the same room). At that point, it wasn't worth calling to complain. Laid down to take a nap after I got into my room at 12:30. Was woken up about an hour later by the lady who came to check the mini bar to see if the prior occupants had used anything. Saw her doing the same two days later when I was leaving. Why not do it when the room is being cleaned?  Still got charged for a Snickers i had to call and ask to be removed from my bill (I HATE snickers). At least twice when someone came to my room, I was in the bathroom, and heard them getting keys out to enter my room....had to hop off the toilet so they wouldn't find me in a compromising position. Last year thought the Whitehall was great. This year....not so much. These seem like system issues, not random issues that could happen to anyone. Stayed at the Whitehall a week for a conference. Pros: Incredibly comfy beds and fine linens. Large spacious room, considering it is an older hotel. I had two queen beds, but there were also two sitting chairs with a table in between them. Each bed had a bedside table. Everything was well spread out, not cramped together. Elevators were small, but fast (last year I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton and routinely waited 5 minutes for an elevator, which irritated me). Beautiful tile work in the bathroom. Friendly, accomodating staff. Lighted makeup mirror in the bathroom. Close to Michigan Ave. Cons: Small bathroom, although this is not unexpected given it is an older hotel. No ice machines on the floors. I really hated this. Every time you want ice, you have to call room service. Then I wasn't sure if I should tip for something I'd rather do myself anyways? TV was old and of poor quality, and the movie channels (pay per view) didn't come in well. As you can see, the pros outweigh the cons.

It has almost all the machines/equipment that you would need or could think of. It's clean and well-maintained. There are jars of ice-cold fruit-infused water with to keep you hydrated, and they get replenished frequently. They even provide you with wrapped earphones in case you forget to bring yours. Now, THAT is ATD. Instead of the traditional folio for your card keys, they have a mock-leather card wallet which includes a card-size street map. Very cute. ATD again. The room was clean, so very clean--spotless and odor-less. It's sort of ATD. I love that they don't have any bed spreads. They are gross and I hate them. Yay, I could just dive right into the bed without pulling it off first. Now, for the nitpicking items: I would've liked that the cute little ""dining nook"" (as they called it) would have some lighting in there for laptop or reading activities. Concierge, eh, that, we could live without. We felt that he was more about pushing his list onto us, rather than listening to us the sort of activities we'd love to do. Tips: We asked for higher floors and I was glad. We didn't have a view of the mile or downtown but it was bright and open. There were TONS of alcohol in the room; it was definitely a mega bar.

The room was a lacking a few things, such as a hook tall enough for a wedding dress, good bathroom lighting and quiet ventilation. Also, a maid had left the door open when we left for over an hour (the deadbolt was engaged, so the door could not close). That could have ended very badly for us.

I was staying in Chi Town for 2 nights but due to a convention in town this was the only hotel that had availability for the night and for $155 for the night I was more than willing to stay since I was getting rooms around the area for the rate of $350 and up! Lets just say here you are only paying for location. I ve learned that the ""older"" hotels are just NOT MY THING. The hotel lobby is pretty and leads you to believe the rooms will be the same. The staff was meh and the room, oh God the room. The room was so outdated! We had a one bedroom but for whatever reason it was two rooms combined into one (score!). For just two people it was pretty spacious and with two bathrooms and two tv sets then I guess I cant complain, but really I have to! The room smells like your grandmothers house and with the fixtures to boot! The carpet stunk, the sheets were stiff, the fixtures were old and dusty and lastly the bathrooms were old and falling apart. One of the bathrooms showers had brown water coming out of the faucet for the first 2 min! Since I only stayed a night I guess it could have been worse...thank goodness. - I also wish I can write a review about Ditkas since its downstairs but it was packed the night I wanted to eat there so I guess that says something good!

The first time I came to Chicago before I ended up relocating, I stayed here. My boyfriend worked across the street in a high rise as security and he suggested I stay here, so I did. I paid $159 after using my ATT corporate code which saved me about $30 a night. The stay was great. They don't just let anyone roll up in here and go to your room. They have to check with the front desk which will call your room and ask if it's okay for whoever it is to come up. They offer free breakfast from 6am-9am on the weekdays and 7-9 or 10 on the weekends. They serve juice, waffles, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, bagels, toast, cereal, sausage, bacon, muffins, and eggs (just and FYI - On the weekends they don't have bacon or eggs). The front desk let me pay for my stay in cash. They also offer conference rooms, vending machines, a swimming pool, internet access with a printer, and an exercise room. I stayed an additional two times after the first visit and my ATT code always worked. The staff was always friendly and they always accomodated me in any way they could or I needed. I would suggest this place to anyone. A great location for the price. **EDIT** There is also a mini fridge, a flat screen tv in the room with cable channels, and a microwave. They do offer room service as well from a local restaurant and the food is great from there as well.

Amalfi is a small boutique hotel that was probably previously owned by a larger chain. I say that because there are a few features that scream ""generic chain"" namely the bathtub. Beautiful granite countertops greet you only to turn around and see a blah tub with a shower curtain that looks much like my Aunt Ethel's (well if I had an aunt Ethel I think it would look like that). Point being...it is a boutique hotel without 100% execution. Don't let that deter you though...there are plenty of positives. They offer an evening reception with an Italian spread. Fabulous cheeses, meats and olives line the buffet. There is an open bar with a wonderful selection. Try the Amalfitini. Even my non-girly drink consuming husband liked it. They also have a continental breakfast on each floor. I loved the fact that I didn't have to travel far to get my donuts and yogurt. The employees were hit or miss. The bell staff was incredibly friendly and helpful!!! Most of the front desk staff was very kind and outgoing. There were two women that were a bit on the snotty side but we didn't let that detract from our stay. The amenities were fabulous! Aveda bath products and they even offer body wash and not the standard bar soap cheaper hotels have gone too. I really liked that. Internet is fast and free! Parking is valet only but we were able to find self parking down the street a bit. Their valet rates however, were the cheapest I had found. Overall, this hotel was a wonderful Italian gem in the middle of the windy city. We will definitely be back! Oh,,,and if you are bringing your pooch they will welcome him (or her) with open arms!

I usually stay at The Wit (a Hilton hotel that always provides excellent service) when I am in Chicago on business. However, the rate was very high, so I decided to stay at the Hyatt since I had a conference at the McCormick Place anyway and the rate was about $100 less per night. I ended up not needing both nights, so I cancelled the second night more than 24 hours in advance in compliance with the cancellation policy. In fact, I was assured I would not be penalized. They did not put the bill under my door. So, as I was reviewing my e-mails today, I discovered that Hyatt cancelled and did not charge me for the 2nd night. However, to my surprise, Hyatt charged $464.85 to my American Express card. Yes, a small portion of that was for parking and taxes. But you increased my rate for the first night pretty significantly! The original reservation was $259 per night. The rep said when I cancelled one night, Hyatt had to charge me the going rate for that day. I was not informed of that rate change when I cancelled the 2nd night. The customer service rep (whose name I should have gotten but I hung up because I was so mad) was incredibly rude, telling me ""It is what it is."" Since I am a Hyatt Gold Passport member, I decided to try my luck with that department. At least that rep was more professional, but she still said there was nothing she could do. I have stayed in hotels hundreds of times, and there have been occasions when I've had to shorten my stay and cancelled a night. Never was I charged more for the nights I kept! I talked to our fiscal office, and they never heard of such a thing either. I could understand if I cancelled both nights and booked an entirely different date, but the rate should not have increased for the original night I booked. Sticking with the Hilton chain from now on.

The continental breakfast has improved over the years - what used to be tiny cups of coffee and a few donuts is now coffee, milk, juice, and plenty of food options. The biggest drawback is that the walls are QUITE thin (the last time I stayed there, my dad was in the room next door and we could have conversations with each other without yelling... yikes).

There were seven of us on this trip and we booked 3 rooms. Although we had three government ID's the hotel was only able to give us two rooms at the governemnt employee rate. They said this was due to the hotel being sold out and so there were no more discount rates avaliable? This did not make any sense. We stayed for 6 nights and 7 days. Never once was the room service the same. One night they would turn dow the bed all the way, the next just take the pillows off, the next they would hide the pillows in the closet.... It was weird. The hotel offers a Select Guest program, which we signed up for before even going to Chicago. When we got there the check-in staff did not mention it at all, we had to bring it up. With the beverage program, as a part of the select guest thing: I would mark for them to knock and bring in our drinks, but the only time it was brought in was the day that I ask for it to be left out..... so strange. The selecet guest program stated that the hotel had a pillow bar, you could pick a feather pillow or a foam pillow. We ask for feather but never got it. We ask a couple of times. The select guest program stated it included a nightly treat and a bottle of water, yet we never got either brought to the room. The internet did not work half the time and we needed the internet as we had to work while we were on vacation. Elevators were weird, you couldn't even take the stairs if you wanted to....who does that? The billing was really weird as well. They charged our credit card 1800 dollars when we checked in and then when we reviewed out billing statment when we were leaving we noticed that they charged us for the internet that we were told was free so they had to go back and credit us. Then it took about a week for the internet charges to be credited. This type of billing caused the fraud department on everyones credit cards to shut down the cards until we called to get things fixed ..... a hassel that could have been avoided had Omni charged per night or at the end of our stay. The location was nice, but we felt like we still had a long way to go for most things, other than shopping. Although this used to be the hotel that Oprah used, it looked more like something Jerry Springer would use. Overall it was just a plain old hotel. I would NEVER pay $219+ tax and fees to stay here again. I would have rather stayed at a Motel 6.

Very attentive service starting from the bellman waiting for the cabs to help you check in to the breakfast crew servers. I also got a $10 credit to the spa or restaurant when I checked in, not sure if this came with every room or reservation. The BEST part is the breathtaking views from the balcony. Request a room with a balcony! As many times as I've been to Chicago, I still paused just getting out of the elevator and admired the views. It reminded me of the Signature Room on the 95th floor. Besides the floor to ceiling windows, the room includes free wi-fi, a 24 hour fitness center with a cool TRX-ish weight pulley system, ipod dock with good speakers, and Keurig machine.  If they could do something about the noise level, it would be 5 stars. Yes, the hotel is in the city so you expect to hear trains, sirens, etc., but the noise I heard was the ice machine and people walking in the hallway. It was loud enough to wake you up at night but not constant enough to keep you up. I met my co-worker for breakfast (their 3 ingredient omelet and potatoes are very tasty) and he mentioned how loud the hotel was too. It's still an awesome hotel.

It's important to specify that this is the Embassy Suites on Columbus when you get a cab, by the way, because there's another on State Street and people get confused!  This is a ""sky hotel,"" meaning that the lobby and rooms are all on floors 6 and higher. You get some pretty nice views, but it also means that you have to catch more than one elevator to get anywhere! Luckily, they have enough elevators and they move pretty fast. The lobby and central ""courtyard"" (like nearly all Embassy Suites have) is really quite spectacular and modern. The lobby does have a bit of a chlorine funk, either due to the fountains or the hotel pool. The bar and breakfast area are right by the front desk and very convenient - the hotel offers a free breakfast and nightly ""manager's reception"" like other Embassy Suites properties.  The rooms were a little dim for my tastes, without good lighting at any mirror to do my makeup. Otherwise, very standard suites. Living room/dining room area, wet bar, separate bathroom and bedroom. Three sinks in total... one bar of hand soap. I'll never get that. The wifi is free for elite HHonors guests.

The interesting thing was that her room had two beds and two bathrooms. I've never had a hotel room with two bathrooms. Very unusual. It turned out to be considerably convenient since her friend shared the room with her. I am told the price of the room was very reasonable. It's right in the heart of downtown.

The bathroom has decent shampoo/conditioner/lotions and a nice shower head, but the best part was the actual full-sized blow dryer (none of these travel-sized junkers). The hotel bar had an interesting array of tap beers. Splash - the pool is on the roof with an amazing view! The concierge was awesome - we emailed him a few questions before we arrived and he answered them promptly. The service when we checked in was so-so.

Although we live only a few blocks from the Dana, we thought it would be a fun way to close out the summer to book a hotel, do the whole spa thing, shop Michigan avenue like tourists, and enjoy some of the things in Chicago that we take for granted since we live here. We had high hopes for our stay and were excited to get a move on, Sunday morning. Upon booking, we were told that check-in is 3PM (normal) but that we should have no problem having our room by 12-1. We got to the hotel about 1230 and were told they sold out the night before and we'd have to wait until 3 for our room. Not their fault, totally understood, so we left our bags with the bellman and went shopping. My fiance had booked a massage earlier in the week for 2PM and at about 1PM she called to see if she could get a last minute manicure after her spa treatment. The manicurists were booked (understandable) but she was also told they had no record of her massage!?!?! - this had been confirmed by phone a day earlier. The massage was one of the things she was most looking forward to, so after a brief phone argument, we marched back to the hotel to get it straightened out. Luckily they ""found her reservation"" and she was off to her massage. I went back out to do some shopping and met up with her at 3PM to check in. We were told the room STILL wasnt ready, but somehow they managed to find us one that fit our reservation. The room was what we expected, small, but modern and cool. The IPOD system was excellent and the bed was super comfy. We requested a room with a balcony as opposed to their floor to ceiling windows - either way the hotel is very open with regards to people in neighboring buildings being able to see in and we received welcoming waves from people across the way. Luckily the blackout blinds do the trick in securing some privacy. I'm thinking that the upcoming portion of my review on Ajasteak should go under the restaurant, so if you happen to read something on that page that seems oddly familiar, you'll know why. Going into the restaurant, I had moderate expectations given that its fairly new and some of the reviews seemed ""eh"". We had an 8PM reservation and were clearly on time since we were just an elevator away. When we arrived, we were told they werent ready for us yet and to enjoy a cocktail at the bar - should be 15-20 minutes. I looked into what I assumed was the restaurant and there were only two tables out of probably 15 occupied and a few parties eating outside. I assumed there was another section of the restaurant that couldnt be seen from the bar area, but when we were seated in what turned out to be the empty restaurant I was BAFFLED. I ran to the bathroom when we were seated (have to take elevator/stairs to 2nd floor bathroom, none on restaurant level) - but the manager came to the table and apologized to my fiance for the wait - apparently they were extremely short staffed, backed up in the kitchen, and had a private party ""upstairs"". New restaurant kinks or shitty service??? The menu was on par with what I expected. We started with edamame (decent, but kind of flavorless) and the Kobe beef yakatori. I'm SO GLAD I opted for the Kobe beef appetizer as opposed to the $18 per oz entree as it was REALLY sub-par. It was served with mini-skewer/toothpicks to eat it with and kind of came across as something that would be served as passed appetizers at a cocktail party. Unimpressive. My fiance ordered the sea bass which she generally loves.Sea bass isnt normally a ""fishy"" fish and it is usually hearty/fluffy. However, her piece was pounded so thin, it was almost laughable and it was drenched in the terriyaki sauce (which although tasty) seemed an intentional overpowering of the sub-par fish. I opted for the lamb chops and upon ordering told the server that although I enjoy my steaks medium rare, I prefer lamb cooked a bit more and he acknowledged my request - OF COURSE, the lamb came out pretty much rare and both chops had a big visible piece of fat through the middle. This was a $40 dish that was worth 1/2 that, if that. I ate it because at that point I was starving. We also shared the ""truffle"" mashed potatoes which didnt have a hint of truffle flavor and tasted more like the buttered flavor out of the bag instant mashed potatoes found at the local Jewel for $0.89. Dismal. Clearly, we didnt stick around for dessert. Fortunately, my fiance and I know how to have fun even when faced with some shitty circumstances, so although on paper the overall experience of the Dana seems terrible, we made the best of it. When we left, our first thought was, ""We're so F'in happy the Dana wasnt opened last year when we booked our wedding at the James hotel"". On the surface the Dana seems to have every thing we like - spa, cool, modern decor, location, trendy restaurant, etc - but they definitely missed the mark with us.

But like so many people have said it does indeed have dimly lit rooms and equally dim hallways. But as two brothers on a trip to see Chicago it did not bother us. I can see how it would bother a woman trying to do her make up since it is darker than the usual hotel room. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Good view of the marina city buildings (aka the corn on the cob twin buildings) from room 811. It is located in a nice area of downtown Chicago with Millennium Park just 5 minutes away and close to many boat tours on Wacker Drive. We were granted a late check out (1pm instead of noon) so that was nice for us since our flight was not until 5pm. The hotel also has free wifi internet which was a nice touch since so many 4 star hotels charge for 24 use of their internet. I used the concierge to check into my airline and print out my boarding passes. They were quick with getting them for me as I checked out. I do agree with the previous post that paying more than $100-$150 a night is not worth it. But then again thats because I got this for $100 a night off of priceline. I could not imagine paying the $250 a night they wanted through their website. Even with the $25 itunes gift card offer thats just too much to pay for a room. I would recommend this hotel to a friend and I would definitely stay here again. But next time I'd prefer the Beatles floor (4th floor), we got stuck with Cheap Trick (8th floor).

The towels in the bathroom were cheap and overly linty.

Great location (despite filming at the time) and the staff were pleasant enough. I later noticed in the lobby cobwebs hanging from the crookedly positioned valances and lights.

The Chicago Hilton is one of the grand dame luxury hotels in Chicago. They've hosted a bunch of presidents, celebrities, rich folks, etc and they've got the system down pat. Luxurious well-appointed spaces, an attentive staff, a tony location and comfortable rooms make this a great hotel. The ball rooms are absolutely gorgeous - dripping in elegance,class and timeless beauty. The spa, fitness center and pool/hot tubs are clean and lovely.  We booked a suite - a great upgrade at only a small price jump - and were delighted by the amount of room we had including many many windows, a Murphy bed, a bar, sweeping lake views and lots of storage. The only downside of the room was the tiny bathroom with very little counter space. Oh well.... I got over it.  One more thing to note - We ate in all of the restaurants (Kitty O'Shea's, Lakeside Green Lounge (the hotel bar) and The Pavilion) and found the food disappointing in each - overpriced, underwhelming, and very limited in choices. Your best bet is to take advantage of one of the many wonderful restaurants Chicago has to offer and skip the hotel's food offerings altogether.

Flash forward - I land at 11pm, am outrageously tired and navigate the terminal to find the shuttle service (which is quite a trek). No shuttle there. I call the hotel to ask if there's a schedule or something, and the woman on the phone laughs and says ""the shuttle stops running at 7:45pm."" Needless to say, I was not happy.

The downside is that we drove from Milwaukee and parking in Chicago is atrocious enough as it is but the hotels valet service costs $50-ish bucks and I was not happy about that. The good thing is there is a parking garage LITERALLY across the street that is only $35.. you can't take your car in and out though and that's only for 24 hours. SO we did that, problem solved. Deets on the Digs: Presumably re-vamped recently, outside of the rooms were kinda run down, I don't know if they pay attention to these things but door frames and floor boards were filthy and in need of a good coat of paint. The elevator was terrifying. I mean, talk about a death box. I am claustrophobic enough as it is but I could barely move with all our luggage. I overlooked these things because of the price and location and then get into the room and it is small but very luxurious. I read others reviews here about the showers and laughed because there's instructions IN the shower on how to use them and I have to say I don't think I've taken that many showers in a 24 hour period, ever. I loved it. The marble in the bathroom echoed and it kinda made me self conscious about using the loo considering you could hear everything. I would suggest some kind of better rug or something in there that would muffle the noise. Also the toilet was confusing, The flusher was on the wall above the toilet and has two buttons that do the same thing. I guess it's a ""fancy"" thing I don't understand but I thought it was unnecessary The bed was AMAZING.. if not for the fact that we wanted to sight see I would have stayed in and slept. I was so comfortable in fact I passed out as soon as my head hit the pillow. Our bed at home is now an utter disappointment. We ordered room service twice and I have to say it was quiet reasonable.

Great hotel, when I come back, I'll be here again. Intimate, plus and private. Love the minimalist designing of the hotel (and all W hotels). Book the hotel if...: if are young or ""feel younger"", into or somewhat into ""urban chic"", and you are plan to take advantage of the hotel's offerings. To book the room isn't that expensive but to take advantage of what the hotel offers, is. For example, their Whenever Wherever policy - you can basically get whatever you want, when you want it (like White Castle burgers at 3am delivered to you by the hotel staff). Rooms: made for couples. Don't plan on coming here with your family or if you do, get separate rooms. For example, there is no bathroom door. Rather, it is a sliding wood door that it not on rails (it's a ""casual-optional"" door and there is a wooden window from the bathroom to the bedroom that is meant to be kept open. LCD's in every room, minibar has everything you want from food to booze to hats to ""love packages"" (condoms, lube, mints and some other stuff). The toiletries are from Bliss so yeah, actual name brand stuff unlike most hotels since most top hotels have their ""exclusive"" brands but they don't mean anything because the dealer only deals to them; so it's actually generic). If you're crazy about spa, they have the Bliss spa experience. They have a great pool (indoor of course); it's open to all hotel guests so no need to do the spa if you don't want. They have a club/bar upstairs that has an AWESOME view of Chicago. If you're a hotel guest, just flash your card since there will be a line to get in on weekends. If you want feel pampered (and you are willing to spend the money for it), you will have a great time here. You can also be discreet to and enjoy all the amenities. Friendly and very-knowing concierge desk. Since it's at Lakeshore, this part of the city is relatively quiet compared to the inner-city. Even with the lounge downstairs and club upstairs, you won't hear anything in your room if you want peace and quiet.

I highly discourage anyone from booking this hotel without visiting it in person first and see the rooms... Dont do it even if you are ok with staying at Motels. i would recommend paying more and stayin somewhere else or stay by the airport and take the blue line if you didnt have another choice in downtown.

(there is a path that runs from the south loop to loyola unversity on the north end for runners and bikers.) you are also walking distance from adler planetarium, the field museum, and shedd aquarium. if you are looking to go out or get a decent dinner, the south loop is not what it used to be. having lived in chicago for many years, i am always surprised how neighborhoods change and evolve. in this case, the south loop is very different than it was even 10 years ago. there are a lot of bistros, cafes, and bars for all kinds of different tastes. going to the northern tourist destinations, like water tower place, will involve a fairly hefty hike (but it's through the city, so if you don't mind a trek, it's a nice walk). the el is within blocks of the hotel though, and is so easy to navigate that there is no reason to pay ridiculous cab fare.

I am getting very frustrated and would like a response. Yesterday (2/11/12) I used my Groupon for the Allerton Hotel in Chicago. From what I understood, there were a lot of Groupons redeemed this weekend. However, that should not affect my stay. At first I was not going to say anything, but I decided to write because I really do not feel like the value of my stay was worth what I paid for it. When I first arrived, I had to wait more than 25 minutes to check in, in your lobby space that is not equipped for long lines. After I checked in, I had to wait 20 minutes for an elevator because this hotel is NOT equipped for large groups. By the time I finally got to my room, I had already been in the hotel almost an hour. Everytime I had to take the elevator (I was on the 24th floor..stairs were not an option), we had to send someone into the hall first to press the button because it took at least 10 minutes. I understand these are complaints you probably hear often and I know the Allerton is an older hotel. However, because of this, it seems to me like it would be a bad idea to allow all of these Groupons to be scheduled on the same weekend. Other hotels I have used with Groupon have made sure to limit the number redeemed each weekend and that seemed to work well. Our room had not been properly cleaned after the last guests. We wanted to purchase from the mini-bar, but when I opened it there was almost nothing in it. The mini-bar was full of empty wrappers and candy canisters left over from the last guests. I called the Front Desk and was assured I would not be charged for this, but that did not make me feel better. To me, that shows they did not take the proper care in cleaning and makes me wonder what else they didn't clean. From that point on, I felt uncomfortable in the room. Also, whoever was there before us set an alarm for 4am and the housekeeper must not have re-set it or checked because the alarm woke us up at that time this morning. After that, housekeeping came to the room at 9:00am to clean. This made no sense to me, because we only stayed for one night and check out was at 12:00pm. Why would they come that early? This morning, I called ahead for my car at 11:15am. I understood it could take up to 30 minutes. The car didn't arrive until after 12:00pm. Other people in line said they were waiting for over an hour for their car. During this time I waited outside. At no point did the doorman or any of the valet ask me which car was mine or if I had been helped. I am someone who uses Groupon all the time and this was my first bad experience. It will definitely make me think twice before purchasing a Groupon again and I will not be returning to the Allerton. After telling my parents of this experience, they called and cancelled their reservation as well and will be contacting Groupon for a refund.

I should mention that I'm not one who cares for a super-fancy room. Besides, how much time are you going to spend in it for anything other than sleeping? But there were some big problems. I'll break it down this way:The Good:-free parking-free internet (we had no issues with the connection)-decent central location-the amazing bellhop (?) whose name I cannot remember. He was a sweetheart and super helpfulThe Bad:-old, old building with THE SLOWEST, tiniest elevators, ever-front desk stuff that were, well, not so bright (best example of this is when I had to get the manager to call my credit card company and reverse the room charge after I told them explicitly I wanted to pay cash. This could have very well ruined my entire weekend, not to mention my ability to shop/eat, if the charge hadn't been dropped)-stairwells smelled like piss-puny, old bathrooms with barely enough room to turn around in(sink is actually located outside the bathroom itself)-very noisy in the halls, and in the room above us (elephants?) and little will on the part of hotel staff to do anything about itMaybe some of my beefs are a little circumstantial, but I still don't think it was worth the price I paid.

By the time I left, I'd gotten used to the place and even kind of forgot some of the negatives. It was an average stay. Room size for several rooms is EXTREMELY small. I think they tried to do what they could with what they had. It is, after all, a vintage 1926 building. I was extremely disappointed with the room size, and, at first, put off by the decor. My eyes eventually settled and adjusted though. Also, it seems to make sense with the boutique theme of the hotel. On the positive, the service was good but uneven at times. ""Superbad"" at the counter was wonderful and even showed my friend and I a bigger room because we had asked to see one. Other front desk folks were average to below average for a four star place. I never used the concierge. The doormen were friendly and helpful. Location is good. Readily accessible to the Washington/Wells station on the ""L"". Also several bus lines run nearby. You are literally next door to Chicago City Hall and in the same building as the Cadillac Theatre and a few minutes walk from the iconic Chicago Theatre and the Oriental Theatre. You're about a 10-15 minute walk from the Willis Tower and about two blocks south of the Chicago River.  The free wine is a great amenity nightly, and they bring some nice appetizers over from the 312 Chicago...a restaurant that is co-located in the building. The food was good (had room service breakfast) and the amenities were enjoyable.  Beds were nice and comfy. Showers good and powerful. The housekeeping crew was tremendously nice and helpful. The place is brand new and clean having just been renovated last year. Negatives? The wireless internet was a continuous problem. Two days, it worked fabulously, and two days it just plain was un-usably slow. I had to go down to the lobby. The maintenance crew barged in on me after two quick knocks one day. I get why they did it, but I still don't get the decor for sure. It's such a mismash of things. My bathroom in my room was very small. The sink was very odd, too. It tended to allow water to swash out everywhere. If you're expecting a run-of-the-mill hotel experience, go to the Holiday Inn. This is a boutique hotel, and it will not appeal to everyone. I appreciate what Kimpton is trying to do with this property. It's definitely a different experience than I've ever had at another hotel.

Downtown Chicago has several options so I researched many of them on the web, and found time and time again the Avenue was coming up with positive feedback. Sure I saw the reviews about noise, but come on people it's downtown Chicago what do you expect? I can attest that the staff was incredibly friendly from check in to check out. The front desk was accommodating with my special requests and didn't make me feel like I was inconveniencing them at all. My room was huge, which is so nice while traveling on business. You have a place to relax...a place to work...and a place to sleep. You don't have to do it all while propped up in your bed like most other hotels. The room was spotless and I'm big on that! I don't keep my home messy so I certainly don't want to pay money and stay in a place that's messy.  Everyone I passed in the hall smiled and said hello, wishing me a good day continuously. I really felt like my business was appreciated and with so many options that is important. The restaurant was good, lots of variety and the hotel is in easy walking distance to all of the hot spots in Chicago. I'll tell ya, some of those other hotels in Chicago could take some lessons in friendliness and customer service from this Hotel. Thank you for making my time away from home incredibly enjoyable

We arrived early from the suburbs, overloaded with our heavy backpacks, but the front desk was super nice and let us check in 4 hours early! We giddily took the elevator up to our room, impressed with the all mirrored elevators and the white, European, short, skinny, boy with a huge blonde affro that stood silently and pretentiously with us (undoubtedly both wondering if he was someone famous). Our room was on the 17th floor. Each floor is a different theme, we were on the Annie Lennox floor (perhaps we'll have sweet dreams we pondered). The view from the room was awesome, overlooking the river and part of north Michigan Ave. The room itself was a view to take in with plush beds, tons of mirrors, and fun modern furniture and plasma TV. The bathrooms felt clean and new. Needless to say, later that night, we had a lot of fun having some pre going out drinks. We had to resort to drinking in our room because the Base Bar within the hotel was ridiculously priced. We also had too much fun travelling to each floor to check out the different themes and memorabilia that was on display. When it was time to go out, the doorman helped us hail a cab, very friendly. Upon returning at night, we fell into a blissful sleep on the most comfy bed I have slept in in a long time. When we checked out the next morning, the concierge gladly held our bags for a couple of hours while we shopped and got brunch. We took time to admire the building one more time before heading out, and you have to admit that the hotel, which is in the old Carbide and Carbon building is one of the prettiest in the city. Modeled after a Champagne bottle, the roof top contains real 24 karat gold. Fabulous! One of the best Staycations I ever took!

A guy will walk up to you and ask you to sign in and then either pay cash or charge it to your room. Good, albeit dirty business ploy because when you're already at the gym, chances stay and finish your workout. - The shampoo sucks; it makes your hair feel like you just washed it with rubber cement. - The showers can't handle any amount of hair.

It is central to everything and smack dab in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave. Until my recent experience, I had never encountered problems with this hotel. The woman, who checked us in one evening, was very rude and did not offer any room upgrade alternatives (i.e., upgrading to a king suite) to accomodate 3 adults when I discussed my initial needs. Instead, she was standoffish, short, and unhelpful, providing us with keys to room that did not fit our needs with helping to identify a fitting solution. Upon walking into the room, we realized how small it was and called down to the front desk to ask for other options from another woman, which the woman in the beginning should have suggested to us before hauling all of our luggage upstairs and having to come back down. I was glad we got to upgrade for an additional $35/night, which is no problem. My other complaints was that Valet service was not available when I arrived and we had to double-park and go inside to get somebody to assist us. The elevators are also very small. I have been charged an additional fees on my debit card; I have called the front desk and been fowarded to the accounting center several times where I have left only 2 voicemails requesting that someone call me back. I am dissapointed and frustrated with the level of service provided by this hotel, beginning from check-in to even after the hotel stay- which I am still dealing with a week after my check-out date.

We stayed at the lakefront location last year and even though that hotel was in better shape and the stay was an overall better experience, we preferred the centralized location of this hotel.  Check in was efficient if not overly friendly. Room was up to date, clean, and boasts very comfortable beds.  Breakfast was well cooked and of good quality, although often a little on the chilly side. Reception drinks were well-made and the line moved quickly. Excellent snacks. The attached restaurant (not run by Hilton) was *wonderful*. Cons: (Small complaint) No automatic upgrade for Diamond members. I didn't bother to ask because this was a weekend point redemption and I was pretty sure they were sold out by that point. It's nice to be recognized for loyalty. Breakfast seemed incredibly understaffed. Tables sat waiting to be bussed for 30 minutes or more. People were wandering around with trays looking for places to sit while 1/3 of the tables were piled with garbage and dishes. The floors were sticky and dirty. The service area was sticky with spilled food and sported balled up napkins and discarded cups. Food was chilly even as it came out of the back because I'm guessing they had to make it way ahead of time. Breakfast was regular-weekend crowded, not line-snaking around the atrium crowded, so I can't imagine why the cooks and bussers seemed to be so overworked. Maybe everyone called in sick that day? Price was bad. Granted we came for a weekend in the middle of summer, but the price on this hotel for that weekend was the same or more than Conrad, the Drake, or the Wit. I opted instead for a rewards redemption, but I had to bust out the same number of points I would have for anything in Hilton's luxury line. So my expectations were enhanced and as a result, I was less than impressed. I love the Embassy Suites chain in general and as we travel and move around a lot, I've stayed at 30-40 different ES properties over the past 15 years or so. This one was middle of the road. The price was exhorbitant in comparison. If you are staying with kids and you can snag a price of say, $179 or less, then give this place a shot. But if you are trying to get away as a couple, there are better choices. Much better. Please don't EVER pay the $349+ dollars they wanted for last weekend.

While many hotels that boast continental breakfast end up having meager offerings, Amalfi's breads, pastries, fruit, yogurt, and drinks were abundant and helped us jump start our days of sight seeing. This also helped us save a money instead of going out every day to buy breakfast. My boyfriend and I do not have any finicky requests when staying at hotels. All we need is a comfy bed to sleep in at night to recharge for the next days activities. If you're a tourist this will be the perfect hotel for you. All of the major sights are within walking distance. Magnificent Mile (5-10 min), Sears Tower (20 min), John Hancock (15-20 min), Millennium Park (15-20 min) - all VERY walkable (which you should do to walk off all that yummy Chicago food!). Also, Trader Joe's is a mere 5 minute walk away if you need to stock up on 17 cent water bottles to keep yourself hydrated as you explore Chicago. Walk south for about 5 minutes and you'll be at the Blue line which gets you to and from O'Hare in 45 minutes. The Red line is also very close by. Although we did not ask for much, the staff was very nice and helpful. We had an issue with one of our keys not working and they were apologetic and immediately helped resolve the problem.

Unfortunately, I was stood up. I arrived 5 minutes early for the appointment and waited in the lobby for 45 minutes until giving up and leaving. The very nice Concierge did her best to try to track down the Wedding Specialist to no avail. After 30 minutes of waiting, another employee physically went to find her and came back to say, sorry she's in a tasting. I'm not sure if she was double booked (she confirmed my appointment the night before) or if the previous appointment ran over, but there's no reason she couldn't have sent word to the lobby with her apologies and/or asked someone else to show me the space. What's even worse is that 9 days later, I have yet to hear from her with an explanation, much less an apology.

When employees at the hotel saw me struggling with my bags and trying to open door, no one offered to help at any point in time even though concierge was present. As for the Valet, it was a complete disaster. We would call 15 minutes in advance from our room for our car and be told it'd be ready in 15 minutes. We come downstairs and ended up waiting 20-30 minutes in addition to the 15 min heads up we gave the concierge. This happened on 4 occasions throughout the weekend. Each time we called down for our car, we would end up waiting another 20-30 minutes in the cramped lobby. I would expect when parking is $45/night, the time it takes to get the car would be more efficient. We were late for multiple engagements because of the timing of valet even when we gave advance notice. This seems to be a recurring issue for the hotel as they are not staffed properly in this dept. Also, the staff that was on hand was not friendly or helpful. Valets/concierge did not open doors or assist with luggage to and from car. Overall, our stay at the Sutton place was a stressful and uncomfortable one. Will never stay here again. Much prefer the Sofitel a few blocks down the street.

We walked into the lobby and the first thing that hits you is the sour moth ball taste. The second thing that hits you is the ""concierge"" who said without word from me or my boss ""you know you have to pay even if you don't stay here."" What topped it all off was the steel gate over the windows, the barb wire fence around the building, the view of the gravel lot, and the tethered remote on the side table. I just felt like I was going to raped, jacked, or knifed. I in fact did not get refunded so I definitely got ripped off.

THE ROOMS ARE TINY!!! I reserved the room online and wondered why it was so cheap for the area, but the web photos looked so nice. Well, because it's like a 10 x 7 ft. room with a dinky washbasin in lieu of a sink, cruise-ship style. FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT STAY IN ONE OF THE REGULAR ROOMS WITH MORE THAN ONE PERSON FOR ANY EXTENDED PERIOD! You could go nuts enough to write in a bunch of ALLCAPs at the memory. I did appreciate the power strip embedded in the side of the desk.. They have a drink at their bar called the ""Crimson Cooler"" -- it's made with organic hibiscus infused vodka, muddled organic strawberries, organic agave nectar, and thai basil. It's my perfect drink. The bar was closed to the public though for private parties half the time we were there, which was rather disappointing and annoying. I'll be trying another hotel next time I visit the windy city. (I feel like such a honkey writing this review.)

We stayed there last November and I'd say that $200+/night was too much. If you can get a discount it would be Ok place to stay. The rooms are very small and definitely meant for 1 person; for 2 persons it is a stretch. Closet space is tiny even for 1 person (it may be Ok if you travel without luggage or planning to stay just for one night). Admittedly, it is a very well kept place (probably in part due to the fact that it was just recently renovated). The shower is huge especially in comparison to the room size, but the bathroom sink has the weirdest design I ever saw. It is so shallow that it's difficult to wash your hands. Internet connection is painfully slow. The elevator's capacity is not enough for the amount wanting to use them. On the bright side, hotel staff is very friendly and attentive, but every once in a while it seems that they simply get overwhelmed and line to check in/check out can be quite sizible. The restaurant (Elate) is exceptional. We ate breakfast and lunch there on 2 separate days and the quality and taste of our fare was amazing. I would definitely recommend to try it. Location is good and fairly central, so you can either walk a take a short cab ride to downtown. Overall, it was Ok experience.

For the love of God. I'm willing to pay three hundred dollars a night for a hotel. What I'm not willing to do is pay two hundred a night, then be nickled and dimed for the third hundred. As I check in, I'm informed that the valet service will cost 60 dollars a day. It's not uncommon to pay for valet service, but 60 dollars seems a bit steep, and it'd have been nice to choke on that figure before I surrendered the car. Use of the internet costs 15 bucks per day -- unless you want a porn-streamable connection, and then it's 20. Use of the gym 10 bucks per day. There is a cheap plastic cork screw sitting on my desk, and I will not be surprised one goddamn bit if a nominal rental fee for its use magically appears on my bill tomorrow morning. And in this fashion, a high end hotel turns in a low-rent customer experience. A particular shame given that the service people are consistently and exquisitely gracious.

I am not a complainer but I felt like everytime I turned around there was something to roll my eyes about with this hotel. My girlfriend and I arrived after a 12 hour car trip from Philly at around 12 am. We knew that places like this fill up quick and called to ensure that our room (that had been reserved 3 weeks prior) was kept even though we were getting there late- no problem. We arrive and they have no rooms w/ beds left...so they gave us a room w/ a sofa bed and told us they'd upgrade for the following night. The sofa bed had no sheets on it, there were no pillows in the room and no remote control for the t.v. OK. Called the front desk, asked for these items and waited. Waited some more. Called again. A guy came up with 1 pillow (when we asked for 2-not an unreasonable request) and sheets. 10 minutes later someone came with the remote. Next day they told us the room could not be upgraded so we were moved to a traditional room (lower then what we originally booked). We got back from doing our touristy stuff, got the keys for our new room and our luggage was nowhere to be found (they told us they would move it), so we had to call a couple of times and have it tracked down. To be fair they discounted us $150 dollars and sent up some free fruit and water(whopee). Not worth the mental hassle and time it took away from Chicago enjoyment. The valet guy - Ed, I believe his name was - was very nice and patient while we unloaded a ton of bags from our car.

We booked the room on Expedia; this was a first for me. Of course, you never know what you're going to get (at least that was the lesson learned). We arrived at the hotel at about 3:30 pm just about check in time. After being completely amazed by the grandiosity of the hotel lobby and the friendliness of the door men, we were met with the line from hell. Seriously? Are there this many people checking in right now? Actually, their computers were down, so check ins were being done...I actually have no idea how they were doing them, but it took a while. As we stand in line, hotel staff are walking around handing out glasses of sparkling wine. Okay, I can live with this.....two glasses later, we are checking in. When the man at the front desk sees my reservation, he mysteriously disappears to the back for what seemed to be 20 minutes. Upon his return he says he upgraded our room to a queen bed.....from a twin??? WTF! Why would you have a twin bed in a hotel? At least that's what both my boyfriend and I heard, but we were too stunned to ask more questions. We were also given a cute little gift bag that we later realized was not from the hotel, but from the wedding party  So our grand upgrade was a small room with not much of a view and a tiny, but beautiful bathroom. Since we were not planning on spending much time in the hotel, this was perfect. We needed a place to sleep and get dressed. We were walking everywhere, so we didn't need the gym and we were not driving, so valet and parking wasn't a concern. The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to Millennium and Grant Park, the Art Institute of Chicago, Navy Pier, Wendella Boat Tours, and a ton of shopping and food options. The wedding events were less than two miles away, so it was a pleasant walk when we wanted to or a short and inexpensive cab ride when we didn't want to walk.  We had the brunch buffet at the hotel restaurant, Lockwood, one morning. The food was good, but it was way overpriced. Although, I'm a sucker for lox and bagel fixings every time, so I was happy. Overall we had a great experience. The convenience of everything close by, made our stay here worthwhile.

A redesign is great for changing the color palette, putting in a hip new chair, and even adding (not free) wifi. That said, walls can't be moved, and floor plans won't change. The short doorways, and single room with more hallway than bedroom are charming to me. I like when old meets new. Free wine from 4-6 is legit, and the location is ideal for just about anything. I wouldn't consider myself a hotel connoisseur, but I really liked this place. The price was right when we booked ($115 for a Friday), but once I'm in the demographic that The Allerton is marketing to I'll be willing to pay the full price. - Free wifi only in the lobby - 24 hour fitness - not the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in, but certainly not bad.

While the bed is still ""the bed"" -- truly wonderful -- the rooms at this Westin feel like a mid-tier chain (Ramada, Holiday Inn). And beware, light sleepers: These rooms are loud. I vividly heard all hallway activity inside my room as if it were being piped in by speaker. As I feared, hallway noise (door slamming, in particular) jolted me awake three times, and I woke up feeling lousy. The TV doesn't have a channel guide, so you have to turn to each channel to see what's on. Like some other Yelpers, I too got locked out during my stay, trying to negotiate their 1990 door fixtures and locking system.  It's all about location in Chicago, and this one can't be beat.

We were already paying $280 for the room, I was not about to cave for another $50. I tried reasoning with her but she refused to budge. She never apologized for the inconvience or even tried to be polite. When I told her that we might have to find another hotel she told me that we already had checked in and would have to be charged the full amount if we left.  I was pissed. So we decided to stay and I would deal with the bitchy lady the next day. When I went to check out I talked to the girl at the desk ( a different one). I told her how extremely unhappy I was witht their hotel. She was a lot better (the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1). She told me that I should have had the suite and that they did over charge me for the double room. She very kindly lowered the bill which I appreciated. She also told me that Angela was a supervisor.

We believe there is no competition and no better choice. We give the Allerton five stars for decor, location, food, drink, service, and overall experience. The Allerton= Pure Satisfaction.

The last time I was there, they were out of standard rooms (so sad) and had to upgrade me to what they call a ""loft"" room. Truly lovely- with a separate sitting area with plasma tv, bar area and a bed that I couldn't seem to leave! Anyone know what is the maximum number of pillows that can be on a bed? As for having everything I wanted? Let's see . . .the rooms are stocked with Kiehl's products (nice), the J Bar is cool and contemporary and a great place to people watch, room service comes on time and the food is hot, and the bellmen must be trained to notice if you have everything you want and if you don't- they run and get it.

We walked to the aquarium though the park and used the tunnels under Lake Shore Drive to get to the aquarium in under 10 minutes. The room I booked was a queen bed with a very small side room with a table and loveseat. The decoration was outdated and with a more detailed glance at doors, countertops and floors, you could see some a need for updates. We used the pool which had not been cleaned that day - however it was a little chilly that day. The staircase was creepy, but I think most staircases are creepy. There was a charge of $29/30 each day to have your car parked. This is the latest in hotel charge trends, but it still seems a bit much. However, it was easy to park the car with blinkers and then jump out to check in and let them park the car. The front desk did offer to get my car at any time. Wi-fi was free and the front desk gave me the username and password upon check in which was great. This was an easy and great surprise as I just stayed at a Hilton that charged for wi-fi.I think the noise level of the city was easy to hear from the hotel. I heard some loud noises at night from the city and hotel which didn't make for the best night sleep. The TV was not outdated as the other reviews suggested, but there seemed to be limited channels.The best dining option was the diner behind the hotel and a block south with great breakfast, dinner and dessert options. For other dining options, it was easy to catch a cab.

The properties in the Middle East (Dubai Festival City, Abu Dhabi) are beyond 4-star service, facilities and amenities - definitely a well-deserved 4 stars. I would rate the property in Dubai at nothing less than FIVE. But then again... the United Arab Emirates would surpass even the biggest critic's expectations!

Thought to myself ""well, how can one go wrong with a name like Heart of Chicago and a AAA recommendation?"" Well, my friends, the answer is - you can go very wrong.  The place is run down (if it was ever run up I will never know) with small rooms offering shabby furnishings. The glass block window in the bathroom looks out to the alley, where on the night I was there, a 2 hour yelling argument between a pimp and his ho echoed into my room. The TV reception was spotty, and I only got 3 stations in well enough to be able to watch. The heat was broken, but not in the ""off"" position. Even though this was January, the heat blew on high and full force to such a degree I had to open the only two windows and sleep on top of the covers (maybe not such a bad idea anyway). It would not turn off, even for the maintenance guy the next morning. I felt like beef jerky when I woke up.  The folks in the parking lot outside were raucous and big partiers. I am not certain if they were guests of the motel or not, but noone seemed to complain or shut them up, as it went on for 3 hours. The included breakfast was a single box of Dunkin Donuts and a carafe of coffee.  My thought about all of this is, if AAA can ""highly recommend"" this place, maybe its time to question their level of standards.

We stayed in a realllly high up room that overlooked the water. It was pretty rad that we could see an up close and personal view of the fireworks at the Navy Pier at night, but overall we were fairly unimpressed by the room itself. Sure it was nice, but we got charged quite a bit extra for a room with a ""view"" and the window was tiny tiny tiny. I just feel like if you're charging for a view that it should be a helluva view . Biggest pet peeve: So we get here the night we got married after we had already previously arrived to settle in, and our room is hotter than dammit at 10pm when we had definitely left the AC running. We call the front desk and tell them about it, and we were just sitting there in our fancy clothes waiting for someone to come up to fix it because we didn't want to be in the shower...or uh, consummating when they got there. So we waited 30 minutes, then 45. After 3 angry phone calls to the front desk, a very friendly serviceman arrives to fix the filter on our A/C. He then proceeds to explain what the problem was. He was nice and we were appreciative, but man, I just got married. I don't care what the problem was, just get out of my room so I can get busy. And of course, we never got any compensation or apology for the annoyance. But I'm still married, so I guess it didn't turn out to be too big of a deal, haha.

The rooms were clean and updated - granite countertops, curved curtainrods, comfy bedding. We had some issues with the wireless internet; 40% connectivity is pretty low when you're paying 12 dollars a day for internet! We had to call our own company IT as well as the Westin engineer to get up and running. Conference rooms were nice enough, no AV problems. Continental breakfast was so-so.

Enough stuff to get a workout in, two overly fancy, overly fussy machines, but it's new and clean and has big windows and iPod plug ins. Couple quick tips: Ask for a higher floor even-numbered room and you'll get a nice view looking East (towards the lake).

In fact, if hookers in the lobby at 1am is any indication, this kind of behavior is encouraged! Seriously. I saw two of them. Overall, great hotel. It's like the Sheraton's cooler, funkier, more colorful cousin. All the hospitality and amenities are there, just rock and roll! I think my favorite part had to be the bathroom. No sliding shower door or curtains. Just a slab of glass covering the shower part with a side entry. Totally something this mod girl would love having in her house. Beds are pretty comfy. What they lack in comfort is made up for in size. I could spread out without worrying about kicking the bf off the bed (which I am prone to doing on a standard queen)! Request a high floor because the views are stellar. I could see the Bean from our window! Oh, and that spiders note by the windows during warm weather is totally true (those of you who have been know what I'm talking about), so keep the windows closed! If there is one reason to stay here, it's the location. You can't beat it. Plus it's way affordable if you ""rock"" Hotwire or http://Hotels.com. I hope I see someone famous next time!

The first time was out of desperation when my friends and I were visiting from Texas and got kicked out of my friends' place where we were staying. This place was the cheapest we could find in downtown so we went for it. The second time I was just too lazy too really research. My own fault. The rooms are very basic, quite small, little to no amenities, etc. But you're paying what you do for the location - end of story. It's steps from Grant Park and the Red Line. But I recommend you spend a little extra money for a hotel with a decent standard of service and hospitality.

Not to mention the friendly and helpful staff. We stayed in the Tranquility Suite for two nights (Fri/Sat), parked our car with the valet, partook in a variety of spa treatments, ordered room service, used the in room honor bar, and also had dinner and breakfast at Aja, the restaurant downstairs. The Room (4 Stars): Price was reduced by 15% b/c we stayed two nights. We also got 60 dollars credit toward breakfast in their restaurant when we arrived. Nice surprise and bonus. Decor is pretty cool and the rooms are unique and spacious. The Italian Rain Shower totally rocks and having the sitting room in the Tranquility Suite was really worth it. Plugged in our iPhones to the speaker dock and enjoyed our music. Fair prices for the bottles of wine in the room and a decent selection from the small frig (though adding small bottles of some liquors would have been nice). Having two balconies was pretty cool, especially to have some air flow through the room. Window treatments block the sun really well, like really really well. Downside - Bed was too soft and we did not sleep as well both nights. Balconies are good to have a smoke on and take some pictures but other than that there's not much room and you have to pull a small chair out there if you want to enjoy it. My guess is that liability and insurance dictated this...oh well. Just don't look forward to a real balcony. Very limited cable television with Showtime that's not HD even though the room has two widescreen flat panel TVs. Also, you can't order movies to watch in your room because they don't have the service. Aja (the restaurant) (5 stars) - Pretty chique decor, fairly priced (on the higher end) and good quality food. For dinner I ordered some salmon sushi rolls and sashimi and they were both very good (and I'm reeeeeal picky 'bout my sushi). My wife did the pork chop and mashed potatoes...and they were both delicious. Pork chop was a large portion as were the mashed potatoes. We also had a bottle of Silver Oaks' Merlot to celebrate ($108 and well worth it, great Merlot). Then we had their apple desert that was both beautifully presented and nicely balanced in size, flavor and freshness. Our server was great too. Really personable, fun to joke around with and down to earth. Some staff members/servers seemed a little uptight or anxious and I'm wondering if that might be a reflection of how they're managed...? Breakfasts were a little high priced for me but having the 15 dollar credit, 1 for each of us, we were happy to go down. Again, very fresh and good quality food. Locks were flavorful, Eggs benedict had a fresher flavor as they increased the amount of lemon (which I welcomed) and their potatoes were very delicious. Refrain from ordering the pancakes unless you want to feed 4-5 people. For some reason they give you two that are two times the size of a large dining plate...no joke, it's friggin' ridiculous. Hope they change it. The Spa (3.5 Stars) - My wife and I had the couples message and pedicures together. She also had a manicure and facial. She really enjoyed her massage and I did as well although I have some hefty knots in my shoulders so I was sore and a little bruised the next day. Overall, it was a good experience but speak up if they're doing it too hard and if their nails are scratching you. The bed you lay on is heated, super comfy and dark lit room and the oils that they use are pretty nice. You also sit in a relaxing room before and after to chill out. Pedicures were pretty good though we felt a little misled because the woman recommended treatments but did not tell us that they weren't included and that we'd be charged extra so watch out for that. Besides that it was pretty good. Quality of the nail polish and durability was a little questionable. Seemed to wear off pretty quickly and she rushed through it a bit. Again, pretty good with room for improvement. My wife really enjoyed the manicure (same rating and experience as the pedicure) and LOVED the facial (she got the Antioxidant/Nutrient facial). Parking, Concierge, Room Service and Bell Hop (4.5 Stars): the staff was really nice here. Pleasant, helpful, talkative and personable. When we pulled up to the hotel we did not have to do much. We were greeted immediately, given a ticket for our car for valet, they removed out luggage immediately, placed it on a cart and took it upstairs while we checked in. A little delay on the checkout but that's because many people were doing so all at once. Same great service. Room service was easy and has food 24 hours, which really impressed us. Prices are a bit high but that's no big surprise. We were happy to pay considering their prices on other things were pretty reasonable. Concierge was more than helpful in making reservations at Aja for us.

They had some magazines,which I love, waiting in the room for me, some CDs, and a very nice robe to lounge around in. The bed was very nice.

Average-adequate furnishings include TV but no frills. Good for out of town guests looking for a nearby place to stay. Main drawback is parking space; on a full-house night it's doubled up parking with just enough space to turn around at the far end.

The entire main floor was hopping with hundreds of well-dressed people socializing, drinking and lounging. Normally, this type of scene at a hotel is represented by a demographic in their mid to late 20s. Not at Public. Here, the social club is comprised of many people who are 40+, but still have it going on. This is clearly the ""it"" place to see and be seen by the non-clubbing club. I checked in at the front desk and the service was very friendly and polite. The elevator took me to my room where I spent a couple of minutes looking for the card reader slot. I then realized that there is no slot, you simply have to flash your card in front of the plate on your door and it opens. That's pretty cool.  Once inside the room, I took a quick look around and was immediately reminded of hotel stays I've had in other locations. I saw flashes of the Mondrian (Los Angeles) with all the white on white on white hues. There were hints of The W hotel chain with all the modernistic furniture and black & white photo/art accents. As many people have said, the aesthetics of this hotel are incredibly appealing, mixing classic old school charm with very contemporary flair. As for the functionality of the rooms, we were less impressed. We quickly learned that beauty doesn't necessarily mean as much when you realize that the shower is so narrow you can hardly turn around inside of it. Once you get out of the shower, there are no robes, either. The bathrooms also have no exhaust fans (or as some refer to them ""privacy fans"").  I needed to iron a shirt and pulled the ironing board out of the closet with the iron. I then spent the next 7 minutes trying to figure out where to plug-in the iron in a space large enough to accommodate the ironing board. The places where outlets existed did not afford enough space for the board. I ended up pulling the ironing board into the bathroom and pressing my shirt next to the toilet. Yes. I did this. At one point, my wife and I decided to check out the Library bar next to the lobby. This is a beautiful lounge with comfy furniture, a blazing fireplace and pretty people everywhere. The waitresses were all wearing these super skin-tight black dresses with one bright silver zipper down their backs. While they all looked sexy as hell, I began to feel sorry for them the longer I watched them having to lean in and bend over repeatedly in those very tight and slightly revealing uniforms.  Need ice? You're in luck if you happen to be on the 8th or 17th floors. Otherwise, you're getting dressed and going for an elevator ride like I had to do. Granted, it was the middle of January and very dry, but our room was incredibly full of static. Everything we touched gave us a shock, including our bed linens. We resorted to turning on the shower in an effort to steam out the static at one point. Later, we realized that because our room was on the 3rd floor and immediately above the main entrance, it gets quite loud. As cabs pull in and out of the valet and drunken hordes of partygoers are coming and going at all hours of the night several honking horns and ""whoohoo"" noises easily came into our room after we had fallen asleep.  We decided to order the room service breakfast the next morning and it was delivered quickly in nice brown bags with the Public's branding all over them. Unfortunately, the delivery guy didn't bring us a slip to sign, so I couldn't add a tip for him. I was forced to pull out a $20 bill and ask him for change...of course, he only had $7 on him, so he got a 50% tip on delivery.  Don't get me wrong. This is a very nice hotel worthy of many accolades. Service is top notch. They spared no expense making everything beautiful to the eye. However, we experienced a few minor inconveniences in our stay that were worth noting here. I think we'd definitely consider staying here again sometime, especially considering the great rate we received $125/night to be in the Gold Coast and Old Town.

The premium room was great for what we paid, stylishly furnished, comfortable, quiet, and with an amazing bathroom (seriously, can I take that back to Boston with me??). The location could not have been better; we bought 3-day CTA passes and barely used them since we could walk almost everywhere. Prompt and friendly housekeeping and a fantastic 12th-floor river view were icing on the cake and even the elevators were never a problem (!!). Now for the bad part: check-in. I'm relatively young already and look even younger, which I think wrote ""take advantage of me"" on my forehead. When we checked in, we were asked if we'd reserved a premium room with one king, to which I responded no, we'd requested two queens (I was traveling with my brother). He paused for a minute and told us he'd given us a city view and sent us up to the room. Well, it turns out he'd given us a standard city view (which wasn't even available on Expedia, but we booked anyway since we got a deal on the premium room). At first I thought I wouldn't complain since it was probably because they'd gotten the wrong information from Expedia, but I looked up the price difference ($70 per night for four nights) and marched back downstairs, determined either to get the premium room we'd paid for - or at least a standard river view - or to receive some sort of compensation. Another staff member was very friendly and apologetic and put us in a premium room. Halfway there, I realized I hadn't mentioned needing two queens and, lo and behold, there was only one king. I elected my brother to go down to the concierge this time and they finally put us in the room we'd requested: a premium river view with two queens. Since the room we'd originally reserved was obviously available, I'm not sure why they didn't just put us in it in the first place. That being said, Hotel 71 was indeed a great place to stay in Chicago. If you can, stay in a premium room. There is a BIG difference, and I should know!

What staff I interacted with were very polite and friendly. Plenty of channels on the TV. Valets were prompt and helpful, but parking was a little more expensive ($49/day) than most of the other hotels I researched in planning this trip. Location is great, close to plenty of shops and restaurants as well as an El stop (red line). And they take the government rate, which is always a plus in my book. However. Two major problems: 1) Internet service is a must in any hotel nicer than a pay-by-the-hour motel. Omni has wi-fi, and it's free if you join their free loyalty program. If you don't join the program, you can pay, and that's fine. However, about half the time I was at the Omni I couldn't connect. I called their internet service line, and the guy told me that their servers were full and to ""keep trying."" I usually had to ""keep trying"" until the next day. To effectively not have internet available is not acceptable, especially in a hotel that gets so many business travelers. 2) Weird smell in the bathroom accompanied by a toilet that wouldn't completely flush. I'll spare you the details, but somehow there were always, uh, ""leftovers,"" no matter what I was flushing. As for the smell, it was not overpowering but kind of reminded me of the poor plumbing you find in Europe. The internet thing bars me from staying here again if I ever come back to Chicago for business. If I ever come back to Chicago not for business I will probably not stay here either, knowing that there are better, cheaper hotels in the area.

The bathroom was quite nice with an oversized bathtub and glass enclosed shower. The bed and pillows were excellent. One of the better beds I've had at a hotel. The hotel bar is really cool and fun. It's open on two sides so it makes you feel in the center of things. It opens and extends into the lobby. There is also a restaurant in the hotel called Eno on Michigan Ave. This is probably the best wine bar I've been to, or at least the one I most enjoyed myself at. It has very subdued lighting and a somewhat dark and rustic decor making it very romantic. They have 700 varieties of wine and killer cheese plates and hand/home made chocolate truffles. Another great thing about this hotel is it's unconventional layout. The first few floors of the hotel are a twisting and winding maze of mixed levels, mysterious statues, large doors to ballrooms, chandeliers, and places to peep out over the lobby.

Air con/heater, clean, super dooper shower, comfy bed and we even had internet access in the room for free which I don't think was suppose to happen but try your luck if you have a lap top. They do have free wi-fi in the looby though and free fresh coffee in the morning. The in room service menu is also pretty reasonable (mains for about $15).It's quiet at night apart from the odd siren of the ambulances going to the nearby hospital but it's not disruptive at all.Location is great too. Red line metro is 2 blocks up on Chicago st, the buses are right outside and it's easily walkable in about 20 mins to Sears tower and Grant Park etc.If you stay here I would recommend going to The Soupbox up on East Chicago st, that was a fab place to get gorgeous soup for $7 and I'm picky about soup.

Huge flatscreen TV and we were given free wi-fi with our deal. They had some cool displays too- different musicians on each floor after you get off the elevator. Our bathroom kind of sucked though. Horrible shampoo and conditioner- it smelled funny. And a weird but annoying thing was that the toilet paper holder is really far from the toilet. Strange. Also, the bar downstairs sucks. Service is awful and they play techno at a Hard Rock place. Makes no sense. Other than that this place is awesome.

Sometimes, we get some awesome deals at great hotels like this. I also was upgraded to an Executive Room and boy was it a treat!!! Of course, the first thing I did was check for the Bible. Unfortuantely, it wasn't lithographed ""Drake Hotel, Chicago, IL"" as in the movie (Instead it was some Baptist Church in TN...disappointing). That being said, the room was phenominal. Quite large with a huge desk, massive king sized bed, free internet, large closets, comfortable desk chair, couch, beautiful paintings on the wall, well stocked mini bar and all of the appointments you'd expect in a top hotel. The best part part about getting an Excutive room is that you get exclusive access to a private dining room overlooking the lake. The breakfast was slightly disappointing, but definitely offset by the open bar and hors d'ouevres until 10 pm every night. Yes, that's right. The only disappointment was the gym, which I found a bit lacking in heavy free weights and size, but it was much better than the usual hotel gyms and adequate for a short stay. I can't wait to go back to Chicago and hope I get the good rate again. Crossing my fingers for another upgrade..... Even if you don't get an upgrade, it's not so bad here either. The rooms are still quite nice (though not as large). The only bummer is that you don't have access to the Executive Lounge with free drinks and breakfast. However, if you do ask, you might get lucky and get a key to it.

But, lo and behold, the charges were on my bill when it came check out time. And I had to argue with the front desk staff to get it taken off, and they acted like they were doing me a big favor. Also, the last day of my stay, the wireless was ""unavailable"" and there was no one onsite who knew what to do to fix it. The # of channels available on the cable TV selection was pretty lame. And like others said, the sheets kept coming off the bed, which was pretty annoying. The good points about this hotel is that the staff (aside from the whole internet debacle) was very accomodating and friendly and it was quiet (although the fact that I was on the 21st floor may have had something to do with the lack of street noise). It wasn't a horrible place to stay, but I wouldn't stay there again. There are much better places in Chicago to stay for the same price. Oh well, now I know...

To your right was the Magnificent Mile shopping area, tons of restaurants, Chicago Water Tower, and John Hancock Observatory.

Another perk was that we located right across from Dominic's Pharmacy. We walked there regularly for snacks. Saving the best for last, the absolute BEST thing about this hotel is: - Complimentary breakfast buffet every morning.

These were of inferior quality with a funky Motel 6-ish comforter/quilt and not a down comforter embraced in a high TC duvet. Yes, I have been spoiled with my Calvin Klein linens. Back to the service... Upon departure and asking for a copy of my statement for expense reimbursement, service was of 'eh quality. The response I got was my stay was prepaid (i.e. ""I'm not going to waste my time printing one for you""). I then explained I needed a copy anyway for reimbursement, then silence and no eye contact (i.e. ""I'm going to ignore your request""). So, annoyed, I then walk out but oddly get my back yelled at in a very loud tone (i.e. ""Ma'am!"" ""Ma'am!!""), 3 times, until I make it out the front door, keep in mind, there are 2 other guests in the lobby watching this unfold.. Unprofessional methinks. Hmmm.... Overall, for the price and the fact that I only had to spend 7 hours in the room, it was good enough.

I arrived at 10:30 in the evening, and by the time I was in the room for 30 minutes I had already made reservations at another place; 15 minutes later I was already walking to the new place with my bags. I simply could not stay there. Peeling wallpaper, chipped paint, mystery stains on the carpet, a truly frightening bedspread, ripped chair cushions, scratched-up upholstery, and a general sense of uncleanliness; but the clincher was the security chain, which had clearly been broken in numerous times before, given the EIGHT bruised nail holes clustered around it. They did offer to upgrade me, but I simply had to leave. I am not a hotel snob, but that room just felt like a dirty motel at a truck stop. If it was $40 / night [in this neighborhood], I could see it. But over $100 / night?!?! No f-ing way. I went to the Day's Inn one block away for $13 / night cheaper...  I hate to be so negative, but they need to know they need to upgrade their facility; in the meantime, I can take some solace from helping others avoid the disappointment I felt.

Got to love that! What can I say about this hotel - the REAL CHICAGO - that hasn't been written before? This historical landmark hotel was the home of many royals, celebs, & in the known people from the Queen to princess Dianna, from many of our former presidents to celebs. So if it was good for them, it's plenty good for small people like me. What I love about this hotel was the perfect location, a few steps to the beach, a short walk to the Oak Street shops, & to the Magnificent Mile. Plenty of restaurants inside the hotel, especially the afternoon high tea, offer plenty of sandwiches, scones, breads, and desserts. Did I mention the insanely gorgeous Chanel Boutique that I drool each time I stay here. Not to forget the beautiful flowers shop with the cutest dog ever looks just like my late dog. & how can I forget the crystal chandeliers & fresh flowers through out the hotels, simply classic elegant real Chicago landmark. P.S. I also earn points with Hilton Honors too!

When I got there the king size bed I reserved was not available so my girlfriend and I had to spend the weekend sharing a double. The concierge had attitude and offered nothing for our inconvenience. We go into the restaurant to get more attitude from the waitress, who forgot out drinks and made us feel unwelcome. I travel a lot, and often get better service in more stylish rooms for half the cost. I'll never stay in a fairmont again, I suggest anyone who has a choice do the same.

When we checked in, we were placed in a tiny queen. I'd understand the change in reservation given the circumstance that I had only placed a reservation to be paid at check-out. However, if I pay for something in full ahead of time, I expect that reservation to be honored as promised. The room we were placed in was in front of the service elevator, and there were meaty spiders inside the room all along the window sill (windows were closed, by the way). At this point I was annoyed. I called front desk and the agent I spoke to apologized and promised to move us into an available suite for the remainder of our stay the next morning and would also send us breakfast on the house. He told us to just come down in the morning after we eat and that everything would be taken care of without any extra trouble or cost. My boyfriend and I figured that we could tolerate our tiny closet full of spiders for a night. We went to bed, figuring that all was well and that things would be rectified in the morning. Wrong. So I go down the next morning, and the agent who ""helped"" me, Kevin, was a total douchenozzle. I kindly explained what had happened the night prior and he said he couldn't place me in a new room, sneering as he said ""I don't know what you're talking about."" Mind you, he spoke before even looking up my guest information and checking notes that had been left by the agent previously. I told him that if there was a problem, I would not mind speaking to his manager. At which point he snapped ""I AM the manager."" He then pulled my information up on the screen and said,""Ohhhh I see"" and rolled his eyes at me. Long story short: after more sneering ensued and talking to me like I was stupid, Kevin rudely sent me away and told me to come back ""whenever"" instead of giving us an estimated time when our room would be ready. THEN he called our room and curtly demanded that we pack our stuff and it would be stowed in storage because he needed our current room NOW. It was 11 AM and check out was not until noon. Check in isn't even until 3. First of all, our reservation was goofed. Then our alternate room wasn't ready. And now you're rushing us out of our current room with no where else to go? Nice. By the time the bellhop arrived at our door, I had decided that I no longer wanted to stay at the hotel and wanted my money back. I went to the front desk and asked the gentleman helping us, Carlos, if there was another manager I could speak to besides Kevin since the service was terrible. Carlos then said,""Hmmm...I'm the front desk manager. I oversee him."" Interesting. I ultimately got my money back and will never return to this hotel. There's a right way and a wrong way to rectify mistakes. Had Kevin been apologetic, truthful, and courteous from the get-go, there would have been no problem. I work in customer service also and I understand that mistakes happen. However, I did not pay good money to be given sub-par service and a terrible attitude when I can get treated like sh*t for free on the street. I left a voicemail for the general manager, who was not in office that day. The director of operations did follow up with me, and I appreciated his efforts in earnest. He apologized, stated that the service given by Kevin was not the kind of service the Allerton strives to provide, and offered to take care of any future accomodations the next time I plan on being in town. I kindly declined, stating that my experience was colored in a really negative way. Unfortunately, a bad apple did spoil the bunch and I would rather spend my money elsewhere.  Not to mention that you can find a much nicer, roomier hotel with much more pleasant staff in the city for less money.  Do not stay at the Allerton unless you WANT to have a bad night.

We took the rollaway option so that our friend would not need to sleep on the floor and were told we would need to wait in the room until the rollaway arrived. After 90 minutes of waiting, I called the front desk and was re-routed to an operator who informed me that there would be a $25 charge for the rollaway and that she would need to connect me to the front desk. After five more minutes on hold, I was connected with the front desk. I was assured that they were very busy and the bed would arrive without charge.

We are using the family picture shot in front of the tree for our card this year, and it was almost non-stop picture taking from everyone who walked by the tree. After we checked in (more on that in a minute) we had to go have a drink in the lobby. The bar is cozy and is in/out of the restaurant, and there are plenty of tables and chairs to sit in the lobby itself. It was awesome just to take in the view and enjoy a drink....we almost stayed for another but had to head out for dinner. With the location of the property (State Street in the theatre district/a block from Millennium Park) this is a MUST STAY while in Chicago. As for the room, the general manager Dean Lane really took care of my family. He put us in the best room I have ever stayed in (The Daley Suite) right on the parade route/State Street, and had a bottle of wine and cookies and milk for the kids in the room.

However I will comment on the lunches we were served and the liquor. First day's lunch was actually an amazing piece of work, however, since it was the ONLY lunch option for the day and I don't like eggplant, well, I was really hungry after lunch. After a normal salad, we were served up truly a beautiful dish of Eggplant Parmesan. 3 Medium thick slices of eggplant were breaded and fried and then stacked with a ricotta/onion mix layered in between. Melted shredded parmesan was on top and a spicy marinara was draped on and around the dish. Truly magnificent if that's what you like. Dessert was a slice of Eli's Chocolate Chip Cheesecake. Second day's lunch was much better. We started off with a cream corn chowder soup (it was a chilly day too) and then it was a Cobb Salad with really fresh ham and turkey sliced on it. Dessert was this awesome lemon meringue tart that was to die for. Both our private open bar and the bar in the lobby of the hotel served up a wide variety of bottled beers and extensive wines. There pretty much wasn't anything you couldn't handle. Also, free wi-fi everywhere in the hotel is always a plus, especially when you're a guest for a conference and you're not checked in. Valet was slow as heck, but I parked in the lot just to the northwest of the hotel for much cheaper.

Got married last Saturday. Down to the wire, we decided to stay in a hotel the night of rather than schlep back home. Hotel Felix had been written up in Time Out and the look and location fit what we were looking for. Made my reservation on Expedia, but called to say it was our honeymoon so we wouldn't get stuck in the musty room by the elevator. The rooms ARE small, but when you have an awesome king size bed with a fluffy down comforter, who cares? What are people doing with all this extra room? I was worried about noise because of the tight space, but we didn't hear anyone all night. Had a drink in the hotel bar, which is always funny, because, well, hotel bar. Blackout curtain is fantastic. We stayed in the cave until a couples massage at the spa on the 2nd floor. Great atmosphere and we were treated very nicely there. Easy check in and check out. Only thought it was a little weird no one said anything about it being our honeymoon when we arrived. Despite that, a good experience.

It was a last minute decision so we called around until we found open appointments. This is how we ended up at The Spa at the Dana Hotel. When we arrived, we stepped off the elevator onto the Spa level and so far, we liked what we saw. The waiting area and hallways were very tranquil looking and contemporary. We checked in and we were told that we could use the stream room in the locker area before our massages. Having had massages at other Spa's, like Bliss (or The Elysian, Peninsula, Exhale, Urban Oasis, etc.), we were really excited to use the locker room amenities. Upon entering, we lost our excitement. The locker rooms here are tiny. Two restrooms, one small steam shower and maybe three showers. On the counter was one hair dryer and typical spa amenities - a few razors, some mouthwash, toothbrush/toothpaste, comb, deodorant and lotion. The atmosphere was nothing special. It was sort of a mess, even though no one else was in there. The ceiling was peeling and there were black stains on the wall (um, mold?!). We were disappointed. Needless to say, we didn't spend too much time in the locker room. We put on our robes and walked to the ""relaxation"" room, a dimly lit room with a few chairs and chaises to sit in while you wait for your masseuse. We were served strawberry-cucumber infused water. They had magazines and fruit to enjoy. The room was comfortable, but we still felt like we wouldn't want to see it with the lights turned all the way up. With all that being said, the massages were pretty decent. We booked 50 minute, $90 Swedish massages. The massage tables were comfortable, the masseuse was friendly and I did leave feeling relaxed. Would I go back to the The Spa at The Dana Hotel? Probably not. With all of the massage options in the city, I'd probably stretch my wallet to go somewhere else or spend my $90 in another way. I'm a sucker for great spa amenities, and sadly, this one didn't live up to my expectations.

Conversely, The Victor Hotel tried to put one over on me and maybe it is not the establishment per se, maybe its the management, maybe even the staff. Whomever it was, I was brought down quickly from a sense of enjoyment to the bitterness of reality. Bartenders, in my experience in communications both verbal and nonverbal one intentionally expresses amicability and in the service industry it pays off. Wrong night. Bartender was not friendly, she threw drinks at me, and she visibly rolled her eyes at me when she could not hear me over the music. I am not saying here reaction was targeted at me. In fact, I think everyone likes me and everyone wants to be my friend. So, I continued on my way and use this yelp review as a sort of awareness blog. Check your ego at the door. Oh and ask for an itemized bill. The Victor Hotel adds both gratuity and service charge...suspect I know

I like the vibe in the lounge and the whiskey blue bar. It has a very nightclub like feel. The drinks are ok the service is awful. I think it was because I didn't have suit on or wasnt dressed properly. They had good music. The rooms are nice, bathrooms are much bigger than I would like. I would like to have had more room in for the room itself and less for the bathroom. I love their bath products by Bliss, they are usually excellent and I enjoyed them. They change the carpets in the elevator so you know what time of day it is. The elevators I think were trying to be very 3d-ish but I think it just got me dizzy and was quite annoying. The workout room was small but they had voss for water. I have been to the W's in New York and would say its about the same but probably quieter depending on which W you are at.

What a fun and extravagant experience it was! The hotel is beautiful, the service wonderful, and the atmosphere decadent! Some things I really loved and appreciated: The room: -L'occitane bath products, the amazingly comfortable pillow top bed, the humongous windows, temperature control, beautiful bathroom, and a waiting bottle of champagne on ice with chocolate covered strawberries to welcome us!  -The window drapes totally block out any bit of light which leads to amazing sleep. -Also appreciated the phone in the bathroom (which actually came in handy once when I needed to call down but didn't want to wake up my boyfriend), turn-down service which comes with bottled water, a wonderful view of the city.  -He also asked to have chocolate cake sent up to celebrate my birthday and what arrived at 8:30 on the dot was an amazing chocolate cupcake complete with candles, matches, and a bottle of Evian to enjoy. The hotel: -The lobby is gorgeous, with crystal chandeliers and a fountain and a jazz band playing in the evening.  -The service was super nice. I actually had a cold and needed some Advil, and called down late to see if the gift shop was still open. They asked me to come down to the front desk, where I was asked if I was looking for medication (indeed I was) and offered a tray of options. Cost $9 but was totally needed and I'm glad I didn't have to make a late-night run to find a convenience store. -Also each time you call the operator for help they call you by your name which is a nice touch. -Attached to Water Tower which was great for a little shopping I had been meaning to catch up on. Some random things that could be better, but are not enough of a big deal to change the rating from 5 to 4 stars: -You have to take to sets of elevators to get to your room, and the elevators are a little small so sometimes you have to wait a little -Although my boyfriend added my name to the room (we checked in separately)--when I arrived I was treated a little like I was trying to sneak in or something, and it's interesting how the service is for a customer vs. a potential customer. Very mild difference, but definitely different.  -There is a way to plug in your Iphone/Ipod into the TV to play music--however it is cumbersome (you have to download and sign up for this app called LodgeNet Mobile) and it takes a bit of time, and even then I couldn't figure out how to use it. -The wifi is free but not that good, actually turned it off and used my 3G network which worked a lot better. I admit I am super-high maintenance, but I loved loved loved the Ritz. For a fun night in the city I would definitely come back again! Can't wait to try the spa next time!

I got this hotel room for me and a bunch of my girlfriends after a dinner at Harry Carey's and it was really quite lovely.

The ONLY reason to stay here is that it is close to the redline. I booked a room for some last minute travel right before New Years. Since my stay in Chicago was going to be over the holiday, I wanted to be close to the redline so I could visit friends. This hotel fulfills this need well. The room was clean, but horribly dated. The counter/minibar area was beat to hell. Huge gouges in it, I have no idea what happened. The bathroom was much the same way. The cabinet doors under the sink were hanging off their hinges. Not what I expected staying on the Hilton Honors floor. Putting an LCD tv in an otherwise 30 year old room does not update it. This is all cosmetic, so I didn't care much. And for those of you reading this thinking I simply put down Hamptons, read my other reviews, I tend to stay at Hampton Inns more than any other hotel. This is by far the worst I have ever been to. There was 1 open outlet in the proximity of the bed/desk area. Huh? some of us have to charge our phone and laptop at the same time. Imagine that The ABSOLUTE worst, is the fact it is across the street from one of the busiest firehouses in the city. Nothing better than listening to wailing fire engines all night. I honestly think the guy that was passed out in the elevator when I got back on New Years slept better than I did in my bed. If you are looking for a hotel in the area, look elsewhere, or bring earplugs.

I'd originally reserved a room elsewhere, but a reservation mixup with Expedia landed me here - and in hindsight, I couldn't have been more lucky! The hotel itself feels more like a hipster lounge than a hotel. Upon entering the lobby, you will be greeted by smiling faces set in an ultra-chic club room of sorts, complete with dark wood and metallic tile materials, falling water and fresh baskets of apples (a part of the W founder's tradition). The entire hotel smells of a light, almost floral cologne - it's delightful. Soft house (read: electronic) music flows and adds to the air of ""cool"". The room we stayed in was not terribly spacious, but it was satisfactory enough. A great view of the lake combined with W's legendary matresses made for a fine stay. My wakeup call I had scheduled the night before even included a recommendation to bring my sunglasses, as it was quite a sunny day. The Bliss Spa is also a luxurious indulgence, I received an awesome manicure there. At night, the lobby turns into a full-fledged lounge, complete with cocktails, cool furniture, a bar and a DJ. Very cool! Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the W. Extremely comfortable beds, helpful courteous staff in an ultra-hip environment is the name of the game.

Bathroom much larger than expected with nice variegated tile. Wireless internet in room $10 for a ""lite"" option that provides quite speedy service, though not hardy enough to stream Netflix. You can upgrade for $5 or $10 additional. Even if you get the fastest option, the total bill for this location ($75 room + $10 internet + $11 tax = $94) on Michigan Avenue is quite a bargain in my book. Solid wood bedroom door to the hallway still permitted me to hear conversations as people walked by, but I was close to the elevator and for the most part my stay was very quiet until my second night's neighbors arrived. I could hear a decent amount of conversing through the shared wall. Elevators are numerous and very fast. Five blocks from the Chicago/State stop on the blue line, so you are merely a 45 minute, $2.50 train ride from O'Hare. Exercise room is huge and adequate. Very nice pre-cor elliptical machines and several treadmills-- all equipped with personal TVs. No pool, but for less than $100 a night, Westin Workout, eat your heart out!

And I think it's because of all the renovations that were going on. I read some other reviews and found that they've been going on for some time. I always wondered why it was so cheap for a landmark hotel each time I saw it on Orbitz. I'm sure the prices will go up once they are finished. My room had a sort of old charm. I originally reserved a kingsize bed, but took the queen just so I could check in early. Queen beds are pretty small once you've been sleeping in a kingsize for the better part of your life. But it was sufficient. Minibar, check. In-room safe, check. Duvet, check. The location doesn't get much better. You're a block away from Water Tower Place and everything you need is in walking distance. If you take a quick trip down the alley adjacent to the hotel, you'll find yourself at a Starbucks, and if you take the alley across the street, you'll find an Einstein Bros. bagel shop. Both among my favorites. My only complaints: They charged for crappy ""wired"" internet. When I checked in, I told them that my flight wasn't until 7pm on my day of departure and they suggested I book another night--which I did. Meanwhile, on the insert that my room key came in, they said that for $60, that they can accommodate late check-out up to 6pm. So I reversed the reservation and told them I'd like to take advantage of their $60 charge instead. When my check-out time came, I called just to confirm that I would be leaving late and the guy said I could stay until 1pm. Why would I pay $60 to stay an extra hour when I could have booked another night for a preferential rate of $90? Finally after a bit of attitude, he agreed to let me stay until 5pm. I left at 4.

I've stayed in some of the worst. The ""Towers"" has hosted me on more than one occasion for different conferences over the years. I've always found the staff gracious, friendly and professional. I will admit it's not a Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental or Ritz Carlton, and on a hotel scale that is the ONLY reason I would think to not give five stars, but for their hotel class, I'm very comfortable giving the five-star rating. The ""Towers"" is clean, well-appointed and has a great location on the river. You can walk everywhere. So what I am writing about today is the absolute ABOVE AND BEYOND service my boyfriend and I received from, yes, San Diego. ""San Diego"", you're asking? Yep. We decided to send his parents here (who live an hour away from in Indiana) as part of a wine and dine Chicago weekend as a combined anniversary/Christmas gift. I called the hotel ahead of time to tell them about this special couple and to ask if there was any way they would consider a room upgrade. **DISCLAIMER: Now I want to make something really clear here. There are times that hotels just do not have the ability or the room to give out upgrades. So please don't think you'll read my review and magically get upgrades just because you ask for one. It helps that this was Chicago in the winter, and thus there was more likelihood for upgrade availability. Well, I received a voicemail at my office from a lovely lady who let me know they would be upgrading my boyfriend's parents to a club level suite. On top of that they also informed me they would be giving them an anniversary amenity, and assured us everything would be great with their stay. They emailed the credit card authorization forms and got everything taken care of in advance of their arrival so all they had to do was RELAX! When my boyfriend's dad - who is an extremely even keeled man- called to let us know they had checked in, he was actually choked up! It is not about a ""club level suite"" or the amenity. It *IS* about making a very special couple know that they are just that - special. My written thank-you will be following, but I cannot stress enough that if you just ask nicely, even if you can't always be accommodated, the staff will do what they can to make you comfortable. While in Chicago I do have many options and several hotels I do absolutely enjoy. However, the ""Towers"" will be my home away from home of choice for not just talking the talk, but walking the walk. HUGE THUMBS UP on my Thumbs Up list! and I mean HUUUUGE!

There is coffee, juices, mini-bagels, muffins, bread, etc and the cocktails are served on the 6th floor and is taken advantage of by probably most, if not all guests.

I felt like a princess as I sat in one of the zebra stripped robes they had in the hall closet while I sat back and sipped on a tiny bottle of Grey Goose from the Minibar. We got room service the next day - I had eggs benedict and my husband the steak and eggs - both were delicious - my limited experiences with room service has been questionable at best so I happy to have warm tasty food that didn't feel like it was just cranked out on a convey er belt (because I mean, it was the morning after Valentine's Day - I'm sure 90% of the hotel was getting room service!) All in all - I loved it. Not all the Kimpton Hotels have as much character as this one - so if you're going to go the Kimpton route - go for the Allegro.

Check this out: http://www.yelp.com/biz/ Normally I wouldn't seperate a restaurant from it's hotel with different reviewsbut this isn't ""ordinary"" Service was prompt every morning (sometimes too prompt) Beds were comfy, turn down service with water left at every bed, nice bath products. Location is great - between Michican Avenue and Navy Pier, allowing us to keep the van in the garage with one exception. Be warned - Parking is expensive here. EXPENSIVE. (I think it was $60 a day) We spotted a small park from our window...perfect for the kids to play while we sat and watched. Waterspout fountains for them to run in. We were the only tourists...others were residents from nearby condos. It was a great find. Why only 4 stars? Besides the cost of parking after you're already forking it over for rooms, on arrival we pulled up at the lower level and asked if that was OK. They told us it was better because the front entrance is undergoing renovation. Then we waited in the heat with 5 kids for 25 minutes for a bellman. Not a good first impression. Also...no pool although they can send you to a nearby hotel's pool. Two hotel lobbies in my swimsuit...I don't think so. And you had to go thru a tunnel at the front entrance due to construction. Creepy. Construction won't last much longer, and I would definitely stay here again! Two thumbs up.

Another minus was the lunch and dinner we provided for our guests. Dinner options were steak, fish, or veggie. The steak was cooked inconsistently, some very well done (and tough to eat), some medium, and some rare. When selecting the steak it was understood all steaks would be cooked medium, unless otherwise specified. To top it off the steaks were very fatty and the size of the steak was inconsistent as well. Some people received huge steaks while others got very small steaks. It was embarrassing to hear one of our attendees make a comment about it. The fish was god awful. WAY WAY over cooked. It was very dry and hard to swallow and this entree also had inconsistent portions of fish. I did not hear much feedback about the veggie dinner, but it did look pitiful.One huge plus is their clam chowder is DELICIOUS! I had 2 bowls!! Aside from the food, everything else was wonderful.

I still have a wierd complex about walking on hotel floors in my barefeet. It gives me a nasty feeling about what i'd find if i had a black light with me.  I also take the top comforter and toss that into the closet because I always hear that hotels don't change the bed comforters as often as the bedsheets. So i've just developed this habit of routine everytime I get to my hotel room. Bust out the flip flops cus I ain't touching the floor and out goes the comforter. The rooms also have an LCD TV, but what's the point of one if they're just gonna give you shitty channels to surf through and the delays to change a channel makes almost watching TV painful.

And because of the season, I was very impressed with the decorations throughout. Unfortunately, my last experience with the Drake was definitely sub par. Back in June, I booked a room at the Drake with my points for a real great friend of mine and her husband to celebrate her birthday. Because it was her birthday, I ordered a platter of cold cuts and meats along with a birthday cake, and even called the hotel and spoke to the catering manager to ensure that the catering department charged MY credit card for these items. When my friends checked in, they were very satisfied with the room, which was great. However, when they checked out, they charged THEIR credit card for the items I ordered for her birthday. I did not find this out until I spoke with my friends, and they told me about the incident to ensure we were not double charged for the items. When I inquired with my credit card company, they did not charge me. What irritated me about this incident is the fact that I had to call the hotel from Florida (I was there for business) to get this entire thing straightened out AFTER I gave them specific instructions on who to charge. What was even worse is the fact that this is very embarrassing to me in front of my friends. Now, I did contact the Hilton Diamond Desk and let them know about the incident and they conducted an investigation on this, but there were also some serious communication issues within themselves as the hotel told the Diamond Desk they contacted me, when in fact they did not. I also called the hotel manager regarding this, and it took them 3 days to get back with me.

It is worth taking a look even if you are not going to swim. Unfortunately, the morning I chose to use the pool, it was extremely crowded, and they only had one lane set up for lap swimming, so it was challenging to actually use the pool for exercise. Also, there weren't any hotel employees to monitor the pool and I saw several people in the pool in street clothes.

One of the best things about the Hard Rock is that most of the staff are music fans so they are laid back and lots of fun. In particular, Demetrius (DT), who served as a bell hop, bouncer and all around friendly face/host really made us feel welcomed by remembering our names and checking to ensure that we had what we needed. While there, I received a great bottle of wine the first night, turn down service, a comp drink at the bar and free pool games and music in the lobby. I highly recommend that Hard Rock Hotel if you are looking for a comfortable, friendly place to stay where music and enjoying life are the vibe and lifestyle.

Our event took place at this hotel so how convenient is it that we got to actually stay here? :) I absolutely LOVE the location of this hotel because it's right smack dab near all the best restaurants and touristy spots in Chicago. And since we didn't have a rental car, my coworker and I got just a tiny bit of downtime to enjoy a nice stroll downtown and have my very first deep dish Chicago style pizza for lunch! And we had this event in May so Chicago...wasn't really the ""Windy City"" that it normally is. It was like summertime. My room here was amaze-balls! I had a huge comfy King-sized bed all to myself and I remember the pillows being marshmallow heavenly snuggle bunnies. The bathroom and the room itself was very modern contemporary, just the way I like it. The BEST thing about the room was the actual view that I had. Such a gorgeous view of the city and the water! I also liked the bar they have here. It was a pretty happenin' spot. I actually enjoyed a few strong drinks here with coworkers at the time (mind you, I don't think I turned 21 yet then...sssh!). They had this HUGE fishbowl of a margarita that came out and after sipping down more than 1/2 of that, I was quite impressed with the rest of my stay. ;) I also like the promptness of the customer service here. Especially when ordering room service. They brought up some late night snacks for me so quickly since I was straight buzzin after that margarita. LOVE me some room service baby. All in all, a pleasant stay here. It would have been nice if I to stay a few more nights and explore.

You could hardly ask for a better location as the hotel is only three blocks from the Magnificent Mile. My only complaint is that their room service is supposedly offered 24 hours a day, but when I arrived at 10pm the kitchen would only serve me sandwiches or salads. The menu is also entirely Asian-inspired, which is unique and interesting on their part, but not everyone is in the mood for sesame-soy glazes or wasabi dressing at all hours of the day. Still, the food was of better quality than most hotel room service options and I thought my ""Chinese Chicken Salad"" was tastier than I expected.

Period. And it feels it's age around every corner outside of the lobby. My first room had a lovely view of the gravel convention center roof and within the first 15 minutes of my being there a maintenance worker walked by my window and looked in. I'm out of there. My next room had a gorgeous view of the Chicago River and Trump Tower from the 26th floor. Unfortunately it had a bathroom light that never turned on despite calling maintenance 3 times to fix it. It also featured a bare metal ""spoke"" where the knob for the heat/air should have been and cracked plastic surrounding that. Nice touch. To top it off, the ""wifi"" was $12.95 per 24-hour period and in my 72 hours there I was charged 6 times. Not to mention that the wifi didn't work anywhere in the 2 floors of conference areas or in the lobby so basically the only place wifi was available was in my room. Thanks. Perhaps I should also mention that I paided $27 for a breakfast (not room service) in the hotel restaurant that consisted of orange juice (no refill) and eggs benedict. Yes, I know this is downtown Chicago but please...

I haven't actually stayed at the Allegro, but my work held its Christmas party here. It was on a Friday in December, and our group of about 40 people were in part of the ""Living Room"" and ""Cameo"" room on the second floor. It was a really nice, cozy, lounge-like atmosphere. There was a large fireplace and uniquely shaped leather couches. I would describe the decor as ""retro chic."" There were a lot of bold prints mixed with dark woods and interesting art. Very hip and cool! There was also an area for the open bar, and hotel staff circulated with hors d'ourves. The food was tasty. We had chicken teriyaki, beef wellington and different types of pizza. It was good! Our bosses actually decided to extend the open bar another half hour because everyone was having such a good time. Another positive about the Allegro is its location. It is just around the corner from our office building, and it is right in the heart of the Loop. The Cadillac Palace Theater is right next door, and you're within walking distance from the river, the lake and all the Loop has to offer. I would recommend the Hotel Allegro for work parties or other gatherings. It's a very cool place and interesting venue!

All of the staff we spoke to were very polite and helpful. They gave us great recommendations on where to go to for food, and advised us on how to travel when we return to the city. The hotel was quite beautiful, and very comfortable. Our rooms were a few doors down from the free happy hour and breakfast sites so my parents were pretty satisfied.

There are lots of hidden fees. Let me count the ways in which you are charged and taxed for every small item. --there is a continental breakfast available on the 33rd floor. However, it is only for ""club members"" though this is not made clear to you. After you sit down with your coffee and bagel, you are given a scrip of paper to sign which states that you will be charged 19 bucks plus 18 percent tip for a continental breakfast. WTF? You would much be better served to go across the black to the NBC building, rather than this overpriced bagel shop. --The POOL costs money. Huh? a 300 dollar hotel room won't pay for your pool? This is too cheap for my tastes. Otherwise it costs 12 bucks a day or 20 bucks for your entire stay to dip in the the not-so-olympic sized pool. Instead, I took a hot bath. In my quickie tour I didn't see a spa or a hot tub either. --The restaurants are overpriced. My girlfriend and I at the ""Chi Bar"" and the drinks were about 12 bucks for a Mojito. I got a screwdriver with the house vodka for 10 bucks. Huh? The drinks at the top of the Hancock Tower, where at least the view is remarkable was only a dollar more per drink. For a small glass of orange juice and smirnoff vodka 10 bucks just ain't right. --The hotel room itself was tiny tiny tiny. Evidently our company footed the bill on the room, so we didn't care too much about the 300 dollar price tag, but the room was not very big at all. --the TV gives you about 24 channels. Ok, whatever, but the annoying thing is that if you turn the tv off then turn it back on, the channel is switched to the continuous Sheraton informercial, which is a peeve. --Another small charge: starbucks coffee cups and a small coffee maker are on the desk next to the bed, far away from the mini bar. However, these cups of coffee cost 3 bucks a piece. Is ANYTHING included in the 300 dollar hotel tag? What will Sheraton do in the future, charge us each time they clean the sheets? My god. --Another thing: it is cheaper to take a taxis than the hotel shuttle. Yup, they charge for that as well. They want you so bad that they charge you 27 bucks each way to ride in a van with uncomfortable seats crowded with other suits. The van concierge actually told me and my girlfriend to take a taxi, and not their own hotel service, and for that he did us a big favor. To recap: at Sheraton, everything has a price tag, and if you can waste money, then this place will gobble it up. However, if you want a luxury hotel room, then don't go here. Your 300 dollars will not give you anything more than a bed to sleep on. So basically, the experience that you get as a customer at this not fine establishment is that they are out to make the quick buck on you, not to provide you with comfort. Hidden fees and charges are not cool, and a 300 dollar price tag needs to include more than a bed and sheets. I have been to model 6's with more service.

First of all, the hotel had a $75 authorization charge per night per room which I never had to deal with before, and it was something the hotel didn't inform us about when booking the room. For some of the students, depending on the bank, the funds will not be released for 3-5 business days. Problems: 1. When checking out, the bill that was slipped under the door noted that I had stayed there for one night (which was wrong since I had stayed there for two nights) and that I owed them for that night. Again, not true since the room was paid in full in advance. 2. The day after we arrive back home, a student of mine notifies me that her bank account had a $368 dollar charge from the hotel. First of all, it was only supposed to have been a $150 authorization. So when I called the hotel, I was informed that it was a mistake and they have no idea why the person checking her in did that. !!!?? How do you not know how to type in 150 and instead type in 368?

My view was of the building next door so that was less than to be desired, but my room was spacious and recently renovated. The dual shower head was nice as well as the toiletries. The place was pretty crowded since there was a convention of sorts in town, I didn't get a chance to check out the facilities because my trip was packed and very short. My only question is why do the stores in the Bloomingdale's' shopping center close soooooo early. I went over there a little after 7pm and it was a ghost town (nothing against the hotel) - just a note for people visiting expecting to get a good shopping experience in. In fact most of the stores nearby looked closed. A bummer because sometimes after a long day of meetings you need some retail therapy.

Go 3 blocks south and it's Millenium Park. Just a block to the left of the hotel, you can catch a bus to anywhere you want.  However, this place was insane. I don't know if it's cause of the bar or what but people were trashed all over the place... boyfriends clinging onto their girlfriends who were trying to run off slurring things to strangers walking by, stumbling around in their heels. This place was a madhouse. The walls for my room were really thin- I swore to god I was in the middle of a hallway but when I got up in the morning I realized I was at the end of a deadend hallway. It made no sense!  This place was ridiculous. If you're a rowdy college aged kid looking to meet other people, this is the place to be. I was here for a casual anniversary weekend with my boyfriend, not to get all liquored up and slobby in a tubetop dress with a bunch of girlfriends, so this wasn't exactly the atmosphere working well for our ""romantic weekend"".

There was a convenient bar/restaurant in the hotel. The food was decent as well as the drinks. The bad. There was no bed cover sheet on our bed. It was simply a regular sheet that was tucked in. For someone who moves around while he sleeps, the bottom sheet constantly came undone and was exposing the bare mattress. Not very comfortable. The room size was a little small as well.

The shower had upscale stone tile and a rain shower head. The beds were very comfortable as well. The valet people were so helpful with getting cabs and loading cars. Another person in group called down for more space to put food, and a refrigerator was apparently brought up in minutes! However, the drawer under the tv was sooo cheap and difficult to close!

This time we were put in a corner room overlooking the outdoor pool and walkway path. This room is definitely brighter than the last room we stayed in since it had huge windows everywhere, outside balconies and full hardwood floors. We also had a direct view of Navy Pier and were able to see the lights at the pier at night. Just beautiful. The room is huge and has a separate area for working with a small tv, desk and refrigerator/stocked bar in it. This room also had a shower and tub we used nightly. The tub was really large and deep. Their beds and pillows are awesome and so soft. The best part of the rooms are that they are extremely quiet and you never hear people walking through the hallway, EVER. The weather was nice enough for us to enjoy the outside area. We went for a walk on the pathway that goes around the whole building and were pleasantly surprised by the sponge walkway. If you are a jogger it will definitely keep you from jarring your legs! We ate at Filini restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner during our stays and have loved every meal we have been served. We have eaten at many restaurants and Filini definitely is one of our favorites. The meals are excellent, gourmet and priced very typical of a Chicago restaurant. When you sit down they bring cheese and bread to snack on while waiting for your meal. The bar is our favorite also. They have huge booths for groups and the bar is just inviting and very beautiful. We had appetizers and drinks and the appetizers were extremely good. We had the marinated olives, meatballs and eggplant parmesan. Everything was seasoned perfect and perfect size for an appetizer. We love to get a drink from the bar and then go to the lounge area with the full length fireplace. The couches make you want to lay down and sleep they are so comfortable and cozy. The staff we encountered are always nice and very helpful. Bob, the doorman is always on task and available in a second. We pick this hotel due to how beautiful and comfortable the whole hotel is. Usually something suffers somewhere but there are no issues that I have found with this hotel. This hotel is placed perfectly for walking tourists. We were able to get to all the areas such as Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue within 15 -20 minutes. Definitely saves money on having to get taxis.

If he were a person, I'd imagine The James to kill in a suit, and dazzle just as well wearing nothing at all. Not to out-do you, but rather to elevate you. That's The James. You. Elevated. And from the start too. No coyness, no incessant wishing and hoping and waiting. He's straightforward. From the time you make reservations, concessions are made, no details are spared. It's courtship from the get-go. I'm still considered new to the city, having moved back only in October 2008. So I get to do all the touristy things and do them with glee. It's true. No sighing or eye-rolling here. I relish it all and challenge stereotypes. For my husband's birthday this year, everything seemed trite. He has enough Ben Sherman to start a boutique (though I did get him a wonderful black nylon jacket: http://tinyurl.com/qnc73p.

The James doesn't have to do much to impress, but it works as hard as it would if it were a Howard Johnson. Of course, the lobby dazzles and yes, the dog biscuits and bowl of water out front is charming but everyone is so damn nice. Ready, willing and able to do anything. Our room was crisp and modern and homey all at once. Again, the perfect boyfriend knew you were coming. Six mini-cupcakes were waiting on a tray with a note encouraging a call if we were wanton for more. The bed was tucked tight and taut, as if you'd be the first to bounce on the mattress. It said just enough about him, but not enough that the mystery wouldn't last for years. And the furniture and art work were West Elm. . . elevated. Like he invented the concept of boutique ""Luxury Liberated"", as they call it. And he probably did. Because he's perfect.

I stayed in the Executive Suite and was very disappointed by downtown Chicago standards. The hotel itself seemed as if it were under construction in some of the hallways; ceiling tiles pushed in with wires exposed, the door to the meter room on our floor was open and not secured. Walking the hallways you could hear conversations in every room that you walked by. The suite itself was way below standard, it contained four closets, no of them were in the bedroom, seating for guests around the table in the sitting room was limited because there were only two chairs for the table, there were two televisions, but of the were both tube televisions. The bathroom was sub par and must have been inspired by a motel. There was nothing high class about this suite. I suggest if you want to experience a true hotel suite experience you go somewhere else. Hotel 71 is overpricing what they offer in their suites, you can find better for their price.

I was able to secure a deal on this hotel through undisclosed means, and we chose the hotel based on the history, beauty, and location of it in proximity to Michigan Avenue. We were set to arrive quite late on a Friday night. I had called earlier in the evening to inform them that I would be arriving late, but not to give away my room, as I had the reservations made in advance. I was informed that this would not be a problem. When we arrived in Chicago, the hotel's attached parking ramp seemed rather hard to find. Though this is to be expected, a head's up: parking was $43 for self and $55 valet. Before you complain, remember you are in downtown Chicago. Stay somewhere else if you don't want to pay for parking. I was immediately impressed with the gorgeous lobby area and entry area to the hotel. Anyone who can appreciate historic buildings will love this hotel. Given the lateness of our arrival, there was not much of a line, and only a few individuals working the desk, which I expected. However, I was rather dismayed to find out that the only room they had left available (I had booked a room with two queen-sized beds) was a ""parlor,"" which is simply a living room area attached to a larger suite. It has it's own bar area, TV, desk, computer, and bathroom, but only a pull-out sofa bed. It was only for one night and we were very tired. Knowing that these things happen, I grabbed the keys. I was, however, disappointed that this happened given I had called several hours prior to avoid this very thing. The parlor was more than adequate for a few people, but if I were to have had a party of 4 or more, I may have been more upset. It did slightly bother me they didn't offer any form of ""apology"" or incentive to make me feel welcome. It almost felt like a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" situation, and did not make me feel very valued. I appreciated that taxis were always available on the Michigan Avenue entrance of the hotel (consequently one of the most beautiful parts of the lobby as well). As a full-service hotel in a downtown metro, it annoys me when people complain about the nickling and diming. Yes, there is a charge for the internet, fitness center, breakfast, and items in the room. This is to be expected, and I will not knock the hotel, as it was my decision to stay here. Other reviewers would be wise to remember that. You're not getting a free buffet for your family of six at this hotel. The next day, we switched rooms to a room with two queen beds and two bathrooms (which I VERY much appreciated the next morning). The only complaint I can make about the rooms are that the windowsills had a lot of dead bugs on them, and notes advising guests to be cautious of opening the windows, lest bugs get in. Advice was noted and well-taken. The beds were nothing outstanding, surprisingly, as I do prefer a softer bed. The bathrooms had very nice gold accents and everything in the room was very well cleaned/appointed. However, when we were in the process of switching rooms, there was a VERY long line of guests, and it took 15-20 minutes to get to the front of it. I was shocked to see only two people working on a Saturday morning during Lollapalooza, which was across the street. They definitely needed more staffing both mornings I was downstairs. In summary, there are a lot of great things about this hotel. It is very historic, well maintained, and I felt a lot richer than I was staying in it. The rooms were nicely appointed and the location was great (though it's still a few blocks away from the shopping areas of Michigan Avenue). I can say, however, that I would not pay to stay here unless I were to get a good deal again, as the service, while not terrible, was very flat and apathetic. The desk agents, regardless of the time of day or night, sounded bored, uninterested, and I got a very unapproachable vibe from many of them, though they were never downright rude to me. Perhaps this is because they are trained to be ""professional"". A little smiling never hurt anyone. The Hilton in Chicago is a beautiful hotel in a great location that is simply hampered by a few rough edges. From my experience, my only complaints were being stuck in a parlor room when I was guaranteed a two queen-bed guest room and the flat service from the employees (perhaps the biggest turn off for me). I suspect that if I wanted to be obnoxious, I could've mentioned my complaints to the desk and I have may have received some sort of compensation, though I am not that kind of person and nothing about the stay (except the room issue) even remotely seemed to warrant that kind of complaining. In the grand scheme of things, I don't really consider these minor issues to be indicative of a poor hotel. We had no issues with the cleanliness or noise, and I would stay here again, though I'd make sure I found a better deal than rack rate.

It was clean and very contemporary yet dark in the lobby. The bellhop was awesome although he gave me a heads up on the slow elevators I was extremely shocked to wait literally 8 minutes for the ONE elevator to SLLLLOOOWWWWLLYYY come down to take us up to the room. The elevator itself took away alot of our motivation out that weekend when deciding where and when we were going anywhere. The room, checking in everything was as pictured however I did for some odd reason think that paying 249.00 a night would have gotten me a little more square footage especially since I upgraded the room to a River View. It really made me wonder what a ""normal"" room size was. The best was the view and the bathroom! I loved it. However by Saturday morning we were callling the front desk thirty times about housekeeping coming to atleast remake the beds and bring tissue to the room! I mean we left that morning at 9:00am and came back at 7:00pm to find our room just as we had left it and without any TISSUE! do you know how frustrating it is to have your body wait for tissue! Although the experience wasn't as great as I wished it would have been considering the very large bill I had to flip, there were little things like the location, valet/parking and view that earned the stars Edit**** I forgot the convenient bar downstairs in the lounge area....its an hotel employee but they have all the alcohol you can take, you can drink in the lounge and watch the flat screen or take the drinks up to your room!

A few complaints -- the ""Business Center"" was tiny and charged per minute to use the computers, or per page for print/fax. And while restaurant prices for lunch and dinner were reasonable (including for room service), breakfast was insanely expensive. Thankfully, the food court at Merchandise Mart has a Dunkin Donuts and a Jamba Juice, so if you're willing to take a walk (all inside, through the corridor connecting the buildings on the second floor) you can get your coffee, bagel, and banana for less than $12. The location was great -- easy access to CTA and some restaurants, right on the lovely Riverwalk, and within a cheap cab ride of everywhere I wanted to go. I'd recommend it to others who are visiting Chicago who.

I knew it was coming, and it was still painful. At least I didn't physically see the $53 charge till the next morning. The best part of this hotel, other than the clean, beautiful lines to it, is obviously the location. Just across from the Drake, you're incredibly close to so much that Chicago has to offer. Since we got there late, checking in was a breeze. We had purchased our room through Priceline and there were no problems. We were quickly sent out our way through the tiny elevators to the 9th floor, which had mostly a view of the buildings around it, but through one small opening, you could also see to the lake. Not that you can see much at 10 pm at night anyway, but I digress. The bed and linens were incredibly comfortable and I slept like a baby. The added bonus to the whole 11 hour stay was the concierge who pointed us towards an excellent breakfast just a few quick blocks away at Feast.

It was pretty lame, only 4 pieces of equipment: treadmill, elliptical, stationary bike and multipurpose weight machine in a tiny little room. Lucky for me I was the only one there and had the place to myself. Not only was the fitness center small but it was HOT, there was no air circulation, venting, fan or window I could open. It was a little hot box. Plus, the water jug they had in there was empty. I checked back on the status of the hot water issue before heading back up to the room and the front desk said that maintenance didn't find anything wrong with the water and they were sorry for the misunderstanding.

Since it was 90+ degrees it was busy during the day but in the evening it was manageable. The first night which was a Sunday we had the pool to ourselves for awhile which was nice. I thought the $250 per night average including taxes was very reasonable for all things considered. Free wi-fi and they did not charge a seperate fee for the pool which alot of places do. They have parking on site for $50/day but we took the train. Cab ride to the train station is about $15.00 including tip. Navy Pier, Chinatown, and Willis Tower is all $15.00 or less each way too. All the shopping, Hancock, and tons of excellent restaurants can easily be reached by foot. This will be the only hotel we stay at for future visits to Chicago. Highly recommend the Avenue Crowne!

For those who don't know, Kimpton is chain of 100 boutique hotels that are located in most of the major metropolitan cities in America and no, they are not associated with any of the major hotel brands.  In the hypercompetitive hotel service industry, I really think that there are only a few things that a hotel can do to stand out. One, the hotel creates a once in a lifetime experience by charging an astronomical price (say...overwater bungalows in Bora Bora) or goes the bargain/cheap route for the price conscientious customer. For most, anything in-between seems to be an experience that is soon be forgotten unless you are tied into a loyalty/reward system that makes you go back to a hotel chain. So what makes Kimpton hotels stand out? Simple. They provide 5* service at realistic price points for consumers.  FACT: They have the highest customer satisfaction scores and emotional attachment scores of all hotel chains operating in the United States. How so? Service: 1) As I checked into my room, I had a hand written ""welcome back"" card that specifically stated that they hope I enjoy my second visit. I visited Kimpton 4 months ago for the first time, and they pulled this info and prepared for my visit before I checked in. Amazing. 2) They called 10 min after I got into my room to see if I needed anything. 3) Three to four hours later, an employee brings me a complimentary bottle of Chianti. Unfortunately I could not have this b/c I had some important things to do the following day so he asked if he could bring me anything else to drink like juice or lemonade. In 5 minutes, he brought me complimentary ""fresh-squeezed"" lemonade. Madness. Perks: 1) $10 bonus perk card for loyalty program members for every stay. You can spend the $10 on anything in the fridge and in the snacks cabinet. They have organic snacks, coke, beer, wine, chips, chocolate bars, you name it. Although they are a bit overpriced, you can pick out 2-4 things without paying a dime. Hey you can't complain b/c it's free :) 2) Rotating loss-leader specials. For example, the Kimpton hotel chain is now offering 2 cocktails for $1 at the bar until the end of your stay. Yeah. Tell me a hotel chain that does that. 3) Complimentary starbucks coffee in the morning and wine and champagne in the afternoon (at the lobby). 4) Free wifi by being a loyalty program member. This comes in handy in large metropolitan cities where all hotels charge for wifi. Add all these perks to a great bed that rivals the Westin's Heavenly Bed and fantastic decor to boot at around ~$110 a night. It is almost impossible to find this kind of deal anywhere. The service and the quality of my stays has made me reconsider my priceline bidding strategies in the cities where Kimpton Hotels are located. For a marginal difference of $20-$30, I am not so sure that the price difference warrants my risking landing an unproven hotel using priceline. As much as the service may not sound ""phenomenal"" for my review, my general feeling is that they would have gone completely out of their way and would have done outrageous things to make me happy. I was sold. Kimpton you won a loyal customer and a well-deserved 5* review!

Things have apparently changed. No room service, no vending or ice machines on the floors and no in-room coffee. The room was clean but a bit beyond ""charming"" in terms of falling apart. The blinds were broken in the bedroom and there weren't any in the bathroom, so you got to pee and shower in full view of the church below and the adjacent corner of hotel rooms. The water didn't drain out of the tub, so by the time I finished a quick shower, I was already shin-deep in water. SICK. The elevators were terrifying.

Staff not that helpful if you're not in the ""trendy"" crowd. Airlines use this hotel for their staff, and if you're there when they are coming or going, good luck trying to get an elevator, a cab, service from the bellhop, etc. The elevators can fit maybe 1 person with luggage and 1 other person. They are extremely small and there are few of them so it takes awhile to get to your room. I waited 6 minutes for an elevator, which doesn't seem like much. But after a day of touring the city, tired feet, being hungry, etc., 6 minutes is 6 minutes too long to be waiting for an elevator.

The room was nice enough. The staff was awkward and aloof, maybe a little bit rude, but maybe they were just having a bad moment....The air conditioning was really loud. There were cords all over the place because the hotel is old and rather than *actually* renovate the hotel, they painted it white. I rarely interacted with any hotel staff.... Except for the valet attendants... and that is where things got really bad for us. We parked our car there both at an hourly rate and overnight over the two days that we stayed there (the first night I drove home to the suburbs to be with our baby)s.... I paid for the valet, tipped the attendants who had parked my car waaaay off to the side (of course!) and got home after our stay to find that my brand new car was damaged noticeably in two places--the fender and the bumper. Mind you, this isn't the 'I didn't notice' kind of damage. Rather, someone tapped (rather hard) against a wall or another car, and another car skinned my car's rear bumper. And so begins my conversion from lukewarm guest to horribly dissatisfied guest.  The hotel gave me the number of the valet company and told me not to call that day because the owner, with whom I would need to speak, would be out of the office. I called the next morning and spoke with Kathy from GP parking who said she would call me back. Three days later, still no return call, I call Kathy, ask to speak to Tom, the owner, she says that she is actually the person I should talk to and 'why did I wait so long to say anything--and why didn't I say something when I picked the car up from the attendants--and not to say that you would, but you could have had an incident on the way home that caused this damage but you want to blame it on us so that we pay for it.....' She continued like that, accusing me of lying and being overall incredibly rude, disinterested and insulting about the whole thing.  So I called the hotel. The ladies at the hotel (first Emelia, then MaryBeth) were nice as pie to me and supposedly did get in touch with their valet company. By their accounts the valet company conducted a thorough (impartial????) investigation and will not take any responsibility for my vehicle's damage.  I am, absolutely, without a doubt, 100% certain that they did, in fact, damage my car. And I PAID THEM TO DO IT! I EVEN TIPPED THEM!!!!!  My friends' Most Expensive Wedding I Ever Paid For As An Attendee/Maid of Honor continues to suck my wallet dry. The damage most certainly exceeds the cost of my hotel room (and I mentioned we stayed in a suite, right?). Of course, Public Chicago is not responsible because the hotel hired the horribly rude folk from GP parking to do their valet for them, but they do charge for the valet directly through the hotel. They didn't even, as a simple gesture, offer to refund the valet fee. Or any portion of my hotel stay. Or agree to fire their valet service, which frankly would have been a slightly satisfactory response..... If they had just told me then and there that they had damaged my car, I would have been okay with it--and I really would have appreciated their honesty. But they didn't have the decency to do so, and now I hemorrhage more money. And, did I mention, I absolutely DETEST the institution they call the Public Hotel Chicago???? I do. I am horribly dissappointed and insulted by the way I was treated.

The hotel slipped a letter under our door informing us of the $millions that they spent renovating the hotel and rooms... From the condition of our hotel, we could NOT tell. There were chips in the wall of the tub and there were spots of mildew, the room had a peculiar odor, the lighting in the bedroom was horrible and the A/C was loud and annoying. To top it off, we had some issues with billing. When you checkout, any hotel on this planet is supposed to provide you with a receipt with any possible charges that you are responsible for, KEYWORDs: Supposed To!!! But the gentleman at the front desk said that since my Mom was using her HHonors points ""Everything will be taken care of"", well, long story short, it wasn't and there were some ridiculous charges that they were throwing at us and all these issues could have been taken care of before we left but we had to deal with this issue weeks after we checked out, damn tards. Other than my 2nd and 3rd paragraphs, I have to say that the hotel is in an OK location. If you're coming to Chicago for the first time, I'd suggest something closer to Navy Pier or on the Loop because this was pretty far from all the tourist attractions. Other than Portillos, McDonalds and Walgreens, you pretty much have to take a cab or walk for miles to get to where you want to get to. Thankfully the concierge was AWESOME. Phillip was so nice and sweet and is the only saving grace for this 2-Star instead of 1-Star rating. He mentioned a tour, one of those Hop-On, Hop-Off tours that was WAY better than paying a cab fee. It was about $27 a person and it took you to all the tourist attractions. Love him! Return stay is not in our future, we will look to the other locations... But can we take Phillip with us?

The staff is generally helpful. The location is great, and with the shops and the starbucks just down the elevator on street level, it's very convenient. Oh, and the bathroom was also very beautiful. However, we found our room to be too small - there was really no space at all to even walk around. The bed was so soft my husband opted to sleep on the floor one night. The concierge helped us out a lot, but you can't reach them by phone - it just keeps ringing. And for some weird reason, the stores cannot give you any change - they are not allowed and you HAVE to ask the hotel staff for change. Weird. I think the price is too high considering the cons.

The ballroom was beautifully done and impressive with its high ceilings and flowery viney gilt doohickeys all over (I'm sure there's an architectural term for this of which I'm just wholly ignorant). Although the '80s-/'90s-/Miami-Vice-inspired light-up dance floor was slightly incongruous with these flowery viney ceiling and wall decorations, the light-up dance floor was definitely WAY awesome when the (horrifically outdated and spectacularly BAD) DJ played ""Billie Jean,"" the highlight of my evening. Was the DJ that bad? Yes, he really was THAT bad. If I knew who he was, his review would make my Barnes & Noble review look like a feather floating in the wind. I did find it a little odd that the ballroom was a two-story setup such that there were twelve tables or so on the second floor, too. This seems like poor planning, and while it makes for a pretty room and more space for the hotel to rent out, it also makes for an inefficient means for the people seated up there to access the dance floor. ANYway, while the decor was generally pretty beautiful and slightly eclectic, I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. Granted, it was hotel food. I understand that. Unfortunately, it was reeeeeally bad hotel food. A three course meal (salad, entree, and dessert), the salad was the best of the three and that's mainly because it's probably really hard to mess up a basic salad as long as the greens are fresh. The chicken was bland and the deceptively rich-and-creamy-looking sauce was just that -- DECEIVING! The cheesecake (not on my list of favorite desserts in the first place) was oddly-textured. So disappointing. In the end, although the Drake would have apparently cost ~40% more for our tickets, I would happily have paid that amount because my experience with their food was in the past much more satisfying and the single-story layout is more conducive to cohesive group identity (i.e. being able to stumble onto the dance floor together without having to navigate any stairs).

Maybe it's because we were there early on a Saturday or because it wasn't a busy weekend, but we had the place practically to ourselves. We strolled in just for drinks on a whim while walking home. It's romantic, quiet and has cool decor.  Our server was prompt and attentive at the right times and the drink list is great. Sure, it's probably $12 or so for the average drink, but it's a lounge-type place where you go to start of the night or to end it. I'd definitely go back if I was wandering by again.

This idea was the perfect solution to a middle of July wedding where outside pictures would equal one sweaty bride, groom, and wedding party. The lobby has a beautiful fountain with lots of open windows that lets in lots of natural sunlight. Past the fountain, there is a whole wing that leads to the ballroom areas and it is beautifully decorated with damask carpeting, beautiful chandeliers, and furniture that is equally modern and classic. The moment we saw it, thoughts of the Drake and the Peninsula were out the window. Of course, we didn't just sneak in with 15 people to take pictures in this beautiful space, we stayed here too! We had an amazing suite with breathtaking views of the city. It was probably the nicest hotel room I have ever seen, and was also the perfect space for the getting ready wedding photos.... And of course, the perfect space for our wedding night. I also got to experience the spa and I had an awesome massage and a fabulously relaxing experience in the steam room. It was the perfect stress reliever the morning before the wedding! If I was a total baller and could have a platinum wedding at any hotel in Chicago, this would absolutely be the one. We were lucky enough to be able to take advantage of this hotel's amazing space for photos and experience the luxury of this hotel for our wedding night. I am hoping we can make another visit on our anniversary.

We go whenever possible no matter what city we're in and usually the Ritz no matter the city is outstanding. It's usually a safe bet for excellent service and quality. Not so here. Now, I'm familiar with the Chicago Ritz. I've dined here many times for dinner and the greenhouse room is a gorgeous place to stop by for a drink (pink champagne is a must). But the tea? Expensive? Yes. Worth it? No way. So disappointing! Everything had been pre-done the night or days before and then must have sat in a refrigerator. It tasted like it too. It had that old food taste. And not just the soggy and stale sandwiches. Everything tasted old. My Mom thinks now that her salmon turned. She later complained of a stomach ache from something but we're not too sure what got her ill there. I probably dodged that bullet because after my one bite of turkey that tasted day old or older I was done with the sandwich portion. My poor Mom felt better the next day but had a bad night. So it was sort of like bad icing on a really nasty cake. There was nothing fresh. Even the scones seemed nuked and were cold in places rather than being recently baked. The rolls seemed pre-done somewhere else. And who eats a cold roll with hot tea? The tea was fair. I'm something of a tea snob and would guess they're buying in massive bulk at a cheap price. It's not Mariage Frres or anything high quality by any stretch of the imagination--but they'll charge you like it is. They treat their teas badly too. They plunked the green and the black teas down on our table at the same high temperatures and then let the leaves sit the entire hour we were there meaning the last cup of tea had turned bitter by then. It's like they filled the pots from the red spigot by the industrial coffee maker. This is not how tea has ever been served to us at any other Ritzes before. Each tea has it's own temperature and time. Usually this is completely respected and every attention is paid to the finest of details. Uh...not here. Add to that not one of the three servers working the entire room could give us any help in tea selection. We each said what types of teas we enjoyed and asked them to recommend some things and the servers went and asked each other before deciding they couldn't ""decide for us"" Huh? Hoookay...... I asked for milk for my tea (East coast girls don't do cream XD) and it took over twenty minutes for the milk to arrive. The ONE time tea was poured for us (the first), (and the pots were HEAVY--too heavy for my Mom so I had to pour for her the entire time) was when I was in the ladies room. I came out to find tepid tea waiting for me. I also couldn't find a server to help when my cup had a huge sharp chip on the rim. After ten minutes of looking around, I gave up and drank from the other side. Ridiculous to have to do that at $30+! One of our water glasses had someone else's old lipstick on the rim. Yuck. We kept asking each other is this the Ritz? Srsly? Ew. Pretty room. Bad service. Bad quality. Horrible after experience with my Mom getting ill. Next time I'll try somewhere else. This is not worth it at all.

We got a deal from a travel site, which made it worthwhile because the location is terrific. The photos on yelp seem to be professionally lit, and very misleading. If I had paid full price, I would have been pissed. But, if you're the sort of person who can deal with a youth hostel, then you'll love it here! The lobby is clean and inviting, but the charm disappears after that. Our room was small, dingey, with blistering walls, painted on crown molding, and worn drapes. No refrigerator or anything, so don't bring home any leftovers. But, on the bright site, the bed and sheets were very clean. The mattress seemed quite new--I'm a mattress inspector the instant I walk into any hotel room. The shower had AWESOME water pressure and got quite hot quite fast, and the AC could pump a lot of cold air in fast. I imagine this place was quite the jewel like 30 years ago. We did bring some leftovers into our room that got a little smelly (before we realized there wasn't a fridge) and my husband took the bag of food (from Frontera, so sad we couldn't keep it!!!) to the concierge and explained he wanted to throw it away. The guy gave my husband directions to the dumpster out back!!! OMG. Even a Ramada concierge would say, ""Oh, let me take that for you sir."" So, anyhow, if you're looking for a place to sleep, take a hot shower, and have zero expectations beyond a clean, safe place to sleep, this is your spot. It is withing walking distance of a LOT of awesome stuff. But PLEASE go find a deal somewhere on line!! If you're looking for romance, indulgence, pampering: run away!

I went to Chicago with a friend in 09/2010 to explore the city. We did not plan on being at the hotel very much as we only had 3 days there (4 nights)... so we went for the great deal. After booking the hotel and reading the Yelp reviews, I'll admit, I was NERVOUS. I don't know who is writing these horrible reviews for this hotel, but in my opinion, they were completely unwarranted.  We were central to so many great places, and very close to public transportation. It was about a 15 minute walk down Michigan Ave to the river and the Magnificent Mile. Grant Park is right across the street. The Aquarium is a 10 minute walk. The location was definitely the best thing about this hotel. We spoke to the concierge staff a few times too, and they were all very knowledgeable, friendly and willing to help. I am not one that has to stay in 5 star hotels with every imaginable amenity. When I'm traveling, I view a hotel as a place to rest my head at night only. Why would I want to stay in my hotel room all day when I'm in a great city like Chicago? The hotel was definitely older, but I think that gives it character! Of course, I love older buildings... my home was built in 1895. The elevators were a little small.. but who cares! My only comment was that the hallways on our floor smelled a little bit like an older woman's perfume.... but whatever! Who knows, maybe someone was staying in one of the rooms on my floor with really bad taste in perfume? The room was absolutely clean and acceptable and perfect for our needs. That being said, if you are someone who does not appreciate older charm & who needs top of the line amenities at a hotel, don't stay here. You won't be happy and you'll just be one of those people who writes a really horrible review for a perfectly acceptable hotel.

SMALL ROOMS/SMALLER THAN THE OTHER HILTON'S: The rooms are smaller than the other Hilton Hotel rooms that I've been in; and, maybe, that's because I was paying the economy/ghetto price for my stay.

The hotel was perfectly located in the heart of the River North area, only a few blocks from The Magnificent Mile and Lake Michigan.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we checked out, we received top-notch, friendly service. Each coming or going was punctuated by a greeting from the door staff. In addition, the concierge was thorough and knowledgeable. The baggage checking department was also extremely quick and efficient.  The hotel offered a relaxing lobby with several couches and even a work station with various computers. The hotel's gym was massive, with tons of weight machines and cardiovascular equipment. Complimentary headphones and citrus-enhanced water were additional pleasant touches. Though we did not eat at the Primehouse restaurant, we did grab a soda in the bar and were impressed by the beautiful decor. In addition, on our first late night out on the town, we found our way to their semi-hidden bar and lounge that served up custom cocktails in a dimly lit, skillfully soundtracked venue. Our room was just as stellar as the hotel amenities. For starters, it was very spacious, especially for a city-based hotel. The decor was sleek and minimalistic with the majority of the furnishings being white. The room came equipped with a large flat-screen TV, a cozy reading nook, mini bar snacks, and a complete bar set with full-sized liquor bottles. The bathroom was oddly equipped with a sliding door, the handle of which happened to fall off into my friend's arms on day one. Regardless, the space was extremely large and offered Kiehl's products, as well as a convenient closet for storing personal toiletries.  Though I have loved the majority of my hotel stays in Chicago, The James had surpassed all of my previous experiences, both in the Windy City and abroad. The flawless service, spotless room, comprehensive amenities, and beneficial location made this hotel a complete package for any traveler.

Loved it here, clean, gorgeous, convenient location close to everything in a safe part of town. I went jogging down the street and by the marina, which was absolutely beautiful. You can walk to most everything or take a short cab ride. The bar and restaurant are also excellent; the food was delicious. My room had very clean, simple and modern lines (7th floor). My family rented one of the condos on the 44th floor with a wrap-around balcony, the views were absolutely amazing. The door men were exceedingly helpful and friendly! I especially loved the outdoor pool, track, and garden area. My only disappointments were that this area closed to guests -- you couldn't even walk around! And the hot tub was not as hot as I would like, and a little too small. Although there was free WIFI I did not always get a good signal. But other than that, fantastic! I would definitely stay there again! :)

The Mariott and Hampton have been a better experience for myself and was just a little more money per night. Paper thin walls that everyone can hear you and neighbors will complain when coming back from the night. You only get one personal warning and the second time they come up they will kick you out by force. We were literally in the hotel for 30 minutes before we were told we were being kicked out. We were kicked out with excessive force by police after trying to negotiate with the manager who was stuck on kicking us out. We had 8 police officers escort people who were quiet by the time the officers came. Not worth the cost for people enjoying the city or even for business trips since everyone can hear everything.  I've already told our sales force to never book any nights here and instead, we go to the Marriott now.

Nice, comfortable, functional, but kind of old school. In fact, I believe the rooms are converted studio apartments. At least ours was. The kitchen was fully functional. It had a refrigerator, range, microwave, plates, glasses, pots, pans, etc. etc. The bathroom was very small, and again resembled and apartment bathroom...not your typical big hotel bathroom. The furnishings were also nice, just dated. Other upsides of this place... The hotel staff was very nice The location is great, just east of the John Hancock So if you are looking for romantic or trendy, this is not your place.

Located at the north end of Michigan Avenue this property is all about location, location, location. In the shadow of the Hancock center, a stones throw from Watertower Place and abundant, restaurants, nightlife and shopping. The last time I stayed here the management was totally inept and I ripped off a seething letter. I was happy to be informed that the individual, who made my previous stay hell, has been relieved of his duties. Other than a long line at check in this property this property has improved by leaps and bounds. Long line at check in as staff was changing shifts. There is a dedicated Starwood Gold/Platinum line. The G/P line was unoccupied as I waited in line and opened, alone with another check in, when I was second in line. The lobby and common areas are very clean, bright, well lit and maintained. In the lobby they have a refreshment center right next to check in line. The room I was assigned comprised of a nice sized bedroom and corner parlor to make up a pretty large suite. The suite was large enough to accommodate several people. Overall First Impression, renovated and on par with the DC and Philly Westin's I've recently visited. This Westin's Heavenly bed wasn't as firm as I like, but all the accoutrements of the Heavenly Bed was there. The room is decorated in a casual modern decor and in good condition. Dcor is appropriate for Downtown urban hotel. The closet was a bit on the tiny side, for a room it's size the closet seemed out of proportion. The 27"" TV is a disappoint, but I understand that they will be upgraded to 40"" sets soon. There is ample lighting in the room and the room has large windows so there is a ton of natural light. The workspace desk shares the ice chest and other items and could be a problem for some. There were extra electric outlets in the room for those with lots of devices. The room has a nice view since it is a corner room. You can see up and down Michigan Avenue. No iPod docking station and a dated radio. Starwood has to up it's game in this area. Very long narrow bathroom, but no separate shower. I found that odd for a bathroom of this size. While in the bathroom I could vaguely hear people in the hallway. The bathroom has dual sinks with lots of counter space and great lighting. A heavenly bath but no separate shower. The parlor connected from the bedroom. Walking out of the bedroom into the parlor there was a nice sized bathroom. With amenities that matched the bedroom bathroom.  There was a large desk with lots of outlets and a great view looking south on Michigan Avenue. The room is a nice size and has a sofa, two club chairs and few ottomans. The is a Murphy bed and a huge closet. In addition, the parlor has a Bose radio.  The housekeeping staff was adequate. I had the DND sign on the door and was never interrupted. They replaced all items and toiletries on each night of my stay. Received turndown service every evening. This Westin features a nice sized Fitness Center with up to date cardio machines & ellipticals, a smaller room with free weights off to the side. There is no pool or club lounge at this property. Free Internet in the lobby, $13 a night in rooms. Signal was strong throughout the suite and suffered no interruptions. Did not use valet, as there is no car for a car in Chicago. The hotel is convenient to public transportation, cabs are plenty and always ready right out the front door. FINAL IMPRESSION Overall hotel cleanliness: On par with other Westin properties and cleaner than the W's Staff attitude, conduct & support: Staff has greatly improved, over my last stay. The staff has had a complete overhaul for the better. Everyone was prompt and attentive. Location: Great location. Can walk to your office (if on business), restaurants, attractions, parks, and shopping. Would I return? Yes. Would I recommend this as family friendly? No. Good for business travelers? Yes. Good for a romantic get away? Yes, nice rooms and spa services. Would I recommend for someone looking for Dining/Nightlife? Yes Would I recommend restaurant? NA Value for price paid? Good Overall property rating on a scale from 1 to 5 = 4.5 since there is no pool or lounge.

The television signal (although in HD) was breaking up every 30-45 seconds, the shower water pressure was very low.Katie at the front desk was lovely and because of her help made our stay.Having worked in the hotel business for over 12 years, this is a property that has fallen in disrepair, the elevators have cracked or missing mirrors, scratches and paint chips are patched lazily, leaving marks.

I found out after arriving that this hotel is right in the center of the infamous Viagra Triangle. AWESOME! Needless to say, this area wasn't exactly my type of scene at all, but it wasn't bad and the location was pretty good for getting to other places. The staff was great and the hotel itself seemed pretty nice, but the particular room we got was kinda lame.  The awesomeness: - Nice and competent staff. - Clean & fairly upscale. - Convenient location for getting to most things in downtown Chicago and the North side of town.  - It was a fairly good deal on Priceline.  The suckage (in no particular order): - Lack of power outlets. Really, there was maybe one free... - Really bad sheets. Not the most comfortable and they just would not stay on the bed. Had to put them back on every night.  - TV was pretty weak. You'd expect a place like this to have a nicer, newer TV. It's not that important though.  - Really poor lighting. This was a bizarre one - it was a very dark room even with the lamps on (there was no overhead lighting).  - Terrible shower. Those detachable showerheads are fine if you can put them to a regular shower height and use it like a normal showerhead - the highest the showerhead went up was to my chest. Is this shower for leprechauns? In addition to the height issue, the water pressure kinda sucked. The shower itself also seemed really plasticky and cheap - not in line with the quality evident in the rest of the hotel. And what's up with the handrails everywhere in the shower and near the toilet? Is this a handicapped bathroom?! - Wonderful 5th floor view of the shit-covered roof next door. To be fair, beyond that was a decent view of a big department store (Barney's, I think) - Room was across from the maid's closet. Awesome! It'll probably look like I'm being super picky but I'm really not. I'm easy to please when it comes to lodging. Basically, I don't need everything to be fantastic - I just need everything to not suck. The hotel just came up really short in a lot of very basic and simple areas that you normally take for granted. And even with a decent deal through Priceline you are still paying a good bit of money to stay here. Maybe all their rooms are kinda sub-par like that - I don't know. I'm wondering if maybe we got a crappy room because we went through Priceline. Maybe they just have a shitastic room they keep reserved for guests who go through Priceline. Who knows. Anyway, aside from the location (which ended up being pretty convenient for getting around), this place didn't display a lot of impressive qualities and lacks in some very basic areas. 2.5

They made an extra effort to make my stays go smoothly (even before I stayed with them often). The Starbucks in the lobby is convenient if not the smoothest running location I've seen. Remember that Courtyards are for business travel, so there's a concentrated rush in the morning. Viand has to be the best restaurant I've ever seen at a Courtyard. High quality breakfast foods (sorry, never tried other meals) cooked to order (buffet on weekends I think). The staff are attentive and caring. If you ask for a dinner recommendation they won't just give you a photocopy sheet like some places (though they do have a brochure)--they'll talk you through what you're in the mood for, and tip you off to newer places if you're into that. This is not a luxury hotel, as CY's are not, but the service is classy! I like that.

The L is right outside, so if you need to go anywhere, it's steps away. And don't worry about it being loud - I slept fine there.  However, I wasn't crazy about their room and decor. They are older, and the room we had was a bit too old for my taste. The bathroom was clean, but it didn't have the new industrial touch many other hotels I've stayed at did. While I like the location of Silversmith, I would still prefer a hotel near the Magnificent Miles, since the Loop isn't as cool at night. I guess it is fine if you're just looking for a practical place to stay while in Chicago, but if you're looking for something a bit more ""special,"" I'd recommend other hotels.

It's an older hotel, too, so it feels kind of grungy. There are two buildings. The rooms are fine. It's got what you need and relatively comfortable. The shampoo/conditioner is pretty terrible though- no surprise there. One thing I found really weird was that they have machines for quick check-in/check-out.

The location is fantastic: close to a variety of el trains, the loop, and other neighborhoods and shopping. The views are beautiful and the bar is a great place to unwind as the sun sets and the city lights come on. However, I've had better experiences at other hotels. Upon checking in, the front desk continuously tried to up sell me. It would cost another $20/night to have a room on the outside, that had a view. We declined, and got a nice room with absolutely no view in the interior corridor of the hotel. They also claimed there were no rooms with king size beds unless we upgraded. I'm not sure if they could see the price we paid, but if so, is there a certain price threshold that grants you access to the nicer rooms? I'd be pretty upset if I paid close to regular price on priceline but still had to pay another $20/night for a nice view. But if you won't be hanging out in your room much, this hotel may be a good bet. The fitness center and pool were pretty large and were open from 6AM - 11PM. The bar had a happy hour which included a complimentary buffet of jalapeno poppers, wings and a crudite platter. The bartenders were friendly and made some excellent cocktails.  The only other minus was since this is on top of a convention center, it is somewhat hard to get to. You enter the doors, go down a hall, take an elevator to the 9th floor, cross over to the other side of the lobby, and then take an elevator to your floor. Not the most convenient entry. Just break up the long trek with a drink at the bar, and it's worth it.

Standard room was WAY to small. Our king-size bed took up most of the standing room. Forget about using the ironing board...You practically have to stand on your head! Luckily my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and really didn't mind the close quarters...Had we been there for more than two nights, or had there been ONE more person in the room, it could have gotten pretty ugly. 2). The fitness center was nice and had a variety of equipment, but only 2/4 treadmills worked. In a hotel that size, it was totally inadequate. 3) The walls are tissue-paper thin. I was in the hallway, a full five doors away from our room and I could hear my husband's telephone conversation quite clearly despite the fact that he was speaking in a regular tone of voice. 4) An in-room coffee pot has become a standard amenity at most hotels...*ahem... Did someone forget to mention that to the staff at the Allegro? 5) Speaking of beverages, where did they hide all the vending machines? Oh yeah, they don't have any. I guess this is to ensure that we'll purchase the high-priced drinks/snacks from the in-room ""wet bar"". The wine hour didn't make up for it either, since we don't drink alcohol. I suggest you take a stash of pop if you're in the same boat. 6) Word of caution: Even though it's located in a great place, surrounding restaurants tend to close early...maybe because everyone heads to the theaters? Don't get caught hungry after about 6 pm. Your choices will be severely limited unless you want to get a cab.Finally, would we stay again? For the quality and price, you betcha!.

It wasn't right on the Mile, but that was fine. We didn't mind walking a bit. The conceirge was great about giving us restaurant recommendations that turned out to be winners.

My girlfriend got married June 25, not at the Dana but we all stayed there. We needed to check in early that day to have somewhere to get ready (traveling from Detroit) to make it to the church by 3:30 pm. The hotel checked us in early over the phone while we sat traffic (at no extra charge), and when we arrived at the hotel with only minutes to spare (thanks to sitting in traffic for an extra unexpected hour) the front dest attendant not only sensed and acknowledged our urgency but took care of everything for us lickity split (literally, we were in the elevator, on our way up to the room within 45 seconds of walking in the front doors of the hotel... as all of our friends were walking out and getting onto the shuttle to go to the church). And we ended up making it to the church on time. Later that night, when we ordered a (extremely overpriced but well worth it) bottle of Veuve, the guy on the room service end of the phone was super cool and the delivery was very fast, as requested. Same with ordering breakfast the next morning - polite, fun and fast. Not to mention, the rooms are gorgeous and clean - we didn't want to leave but couldn't afford to stay.

Housekeeping would come to our room but would leave a pile of dirty towels on the floor and one day housekeeping came to our door at 8 in the morning to chastise my father for calling the front desk after our room had not been cleaned. I thought it was completely unprofessional and unwarranted. Additionally, when I ordered a bread pudding from room service there were moldy strawberries on the plate. Although I enjoyed the first week of my stay, I felt like the last two did not match up quality and service-wise.

The lobby is beautiful & luxurious and I couldn't wait to check-in and relax in our room. And here's where it all went downhill. The front desk clerk was a little on the snippy side. We were given our keys and sent on our way only to find that she had given us a room with ONE double bed which is not what we had reserved. You would think the front desk clerk would have thought something was amiss when she checked us in. My husband was standing right there and at 6'6 would barely fit in that bed by himself, let alone the both of us. I immediately called down only to be placed on hold for an eternity so the manager could be consulted. The manager never even bothered to speak to us to apologize and had the clerk handle it. I had to tell them that I had the printed documentation/receipts that proved we were guaranteed more than that. At this point, the only room available was a handicapped room with 2 double beds. At least one of us wouldn't have to sleep on the floor. By the way, the first room we were given was quite shabby and on par with a ""Days Inn"" level. The wallpaper was peeling. The furniture looked old & worn. The second room looked like it was more recently updated but still lacked the oomph that nice hotels should have. It was a failed attempt at replicating the look of Kimpton Hotel properties. The TV was extremely dated. No wifi!!!!!! In this day & age???? And, of course, they charge for it.

To top it off the organizer neglected to tell me that there were so many stops on El train from Ohare to here, so it was close to another hour of traveling.

One of her co-workers overheard our discussion, came over and said to just put a $50 hold for the entire stay. Amanda's eyes lit up and said, ""what if something happens""? Um, hello, I'm standing right in front of you! Her very nice co-worker said it was fine, helped her set it up and walked away. At that point Amanda was PISSED!!! I asked for two keys, she just glared at me and angrily grabbed another key. I went up to my room and that was it. I did t see Miss By The Book Amanda until I was checking out. I understand there are rules, but c'mon a $250 hold on my debit card, which will take 7-10 days to fall off- I don't think so. Other than that issue, our stay at the Avenue was fine. The water pressure was pretty good and when the shower wouldn't drain, they fixed it immediately. Despite Amanda, I'd stay there again.

At first I was a little taken aback with regard to the size and configuration of the rooms, but then I remembered it was just remodeled not built new so it's not really set up for some of what I'd call more 'modern-sized americans.' My issues with the room through were three-fold. First, the air filter hadn't been changed in a while, so it was dirty and would bang back down onto the ceiling after the unit shut off. Easily fixed. Second, the apparent lack of storage. Yes there was a tiny closet, but where do I put all of the other crap I had with me for a week long stay? Then I discovered the dresser drawer hidden below the bed (I had a king room). Neato! Third, and this was the one issue I couldn't correct, the lighting. Argh. It was so 'energy-efficient' that it was nonexistent in certain parts of the room... like on the desk! Not cool when you're here for a work trip. And yeah there are LED task lights on the desktop but it didn't improve the situation any... so I ended up doing most of my work on the bed itself - though not without banging my knees on the wood sideboard a couple of times. I didn't spend a bunch of time in the room, but who wants to do that anyway when you're in another city? Other than those qualms, I really liked Felix, and the price we got through Priceline ($99/night, I think) made it much more manageable. I really enjoyed the location, within easy walking distance from some awesome restaurants, public transit, and whole foods, and just a generally relaxed vibe with nice staff. Next time I'm in Chicago I'll definitely stay here again.

However, the hotel shares a flaw with many of the hotels in which I've stayed in Chicago, San Francisco and other cities: size. The rooms looked a lot bigger on http://www.getaroom.com, and the lobby itself seemed rather small. Also, the elevators (these were small too) were beyond confusing. You have to go up to the 3rd floor to then get on another elevator? I've never seen that before. The hotel isn't perfect, but you get what you pay for. You'll still have a comfortable stay at a reasonable price.

But, having said that, I actually enjoyed my recent stay here while attending a medical convention. Overall, this hotel suited my needs as a business traveller. I was greeted very warmly by the receptionist upon check in . The lobby was contemporary/ minimalist, but beautifully decorated with flowers and candles that made a good first impression. I found my room to be pretty standard business class, but the bed was extremely comfortable with thick down pillows and eqyptian cotton sheets. The room had a full mini-bar, an LG flat screen TV, DVD player (hotel had a nice video library that I did not sample), an IPod docking station, nice bath robe, bliss bath toilettries, and 24-hr room service. As a single traveller, I did not mind the window with shutters that opened to the bedroom from the bath. I actually liked to have the shutters open so that I could watch TV from the bathroom while brushing my teeth in the morning.  The elevator ride down to the lobby was usually awkward in the morning, as strangers in business attire crammed in next to me in this dimly lit minidisco with piped in sexy disco musak. The entire lobby turned into a night club on most evenings during my stay. It was a lively scene, and I found that my colleagues were all eager to participate. We tried the restaurant ""Wave"" for lunch and dinner and I would highly recommend it. I sampled many of the dishes from the tapas-style menu and they were excellent, including hummus, spinach and feta pastries, flank steak, and octopus.  The hotel is conveniently located a few short blocks from Michigan ave with it's fantastic shops and restaurants. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would probably stay here again.

Not a bad deal for a pretty primo location near most things that you would want to do. So I showed up a few hours later than my friends and went to find the room on my own. Be sure to ask which side your friends are on (West or East) as there are two separate buildings across the street from each other. Naturally my friends were in the other tower so I had to truck it across the street. But no worries, it is fairly easy to navigate. Rooms: sensor locks, HDTV, coffee maker, decent sized bathroom, blow dryer, etc. Beds were comfy and I love the pillows. The room had pretty thin walls - we could hear the neighbor's conversation and TV show through the bathroom walls, and people walking down the hall could be heard very well. Just bring earplugs which, to me, is mandatory to get sleep in any hotel anyway. If you stay up high enough you will have really good views of the city. Oh and they have the blackout curtains like the ones you get in Vegas hotel rooms. This is the BEST. All places should have these. Hotel itself had a bar, a huge spacious lobby, a little market with Starbucks, ATM, gift shop, etc. Cabs were easy to get and there wasn't really a line.

The staff are friendly and helpful, and the bartenders are more than willing to get a little creative if need be. Unfortunately the luxury aesthetics of the hotel are reflected by its price tag, the rooms start at $200 a night and go up, the food in the restaurant is top-notch but also top-tier, same for the bar and other amenities such as $18/stay internet. Unfortunately there is also no wireless within the rooms and cell phone signal is non-existant within most of the building, both of these are probably factored in by the fact that the building has quite a bit of marble in the interior which will block both of these signals. Staying in downtown chicago I thought there would be a good variety of selection for food, however outside of a pizza place one block away, and a hot dog place 5 blocks away everything consisted of the same recurrent chains every block - you will see at least one of these every 2 blocks: subway, mcdonalds, 7/11, cvs, starbucks - outside of that and the two independently run places i mentioned earlier the closest thing is a trip to the greek section which is about 2 miles away.

Check-in went all right, although I'm still pretty sure that the check-in woman at the front desk never looked up from typing, she was short and rude while assigning me a room key - not the way you want your guests to see a first impression.   After getting to our room, we discovered that even though it's an old hotel, they had upgraded their TV's, to probably 26 inch flat screens, a nice touch. Only then to discover that THERE IS NO HEAT IN THE ROOM. After realizing I could not control the temperature in the room, I phoned the front desk and ask about the heat and I was rudely informed ""there's no heat in the entire building."" This is Chicago, and even in October it's cold, I can't imagine anyone staying in this hotel in the Winter - you will spend all your time under the covers or in the shower.   That brings me to the shower. The shower head was detached from the wall, hanging 2-3 inches off the wall (as in broken, not by design). The water pressure was more like a leaky pipe. Also it took forever to get the water warm (like 5 minutes) and I mean warm, not hot, it was never hot.   I tried to get a late check out as we wanted to walk around the city for a while before our flight out later in the day and they would not accommodate that, a fairly common request among hotel guests. We had to check out by the time given, and were told we could leave our luggage with the bell hop for free while we toured the city.   After checking out at the front desk, I was directed to the bell hop station to check my luggage. After waiting in line for 25 minutes I set my bags down to be checked - the bell hop asked if one of my bags was a computer to which I said ""yes."" He then rudely told me I could not store my computer there, that I would have to go to the front desk and have it checked by security. I asked him why no one at the front desk had bothered to tell me this when I checked out and asked where to check my things, and he responded ""that's not my job!"" I explained to him that I was aware of that, but a friendly suggestion to let the front desk people know that would go far with the guests. He literally got in my face, told me he didn't like my attitude and refused to check my bag. Mind you, I was upset, but I was not yelling, nor was I raising my voice or being out of line.   I then walked to the front desk, explained the situation to the 6 girls chatting behind the front desk and they stared at me like I was from outer-space. The one girl who handled my check out said ""well how was I supposed to know you had a computer?"" I responded with ""why don't you just tack on to everyone you tell about the baggage check, ""also, if you have a computer with you, we need to store it in a separate room with Security."" I am not joking, it's like I was trying to teach them complex math equations, they stared at me blankly like they didn't understand customer service. Security finally came and stored my bags for me. Mind you, I don't have a problem with storing laptops separately, in fact I think it's a great idea considering their baggage check is right next to the front door which is easily accessible to thieves. I just had a problem with no one taking any responsibility and not one hotel employee showing any care for customer service.   I apologize for this being so long winded, but I felt this was a story that needed to be told. I'm 32 years old, I'm not some old man who just complains about everything. I stay in dozens of hotels all year long, and this by far was the worst experience I've had in probably 10 years. I've never more in my life felt like I wasted money on something.

I told them that I spoke with someone about the mixup and after about 15 minutes of standing at the desk the manager comes out. They said it was their fault and gave us a room. I was almost in tears from frustration but they finally set us up with a room so I was happy - for a little while. After exploring the hotel we went back to our room and tried to turn the heat up but it wasn't working so we had to call up maintenance to fix the heater. It probably took them an hour to figure out the problem and fix it. My boyfriend and I stepped out for 10 minutes to pick up some alcohol and when we came back the room smelled like burnt hair. Gross! It was getting late so we just decided to spray a bunch of my perfume to cover the smell. I was so stressed out that we decided to leave the Hilton and find another hotel.

The location was perfect for the marathon as it was close to the start and finish, and it is very close to the theatre district as this was convenient for when I went to ""wicked"". Travellers must note that this hotel is located in the Financial district. On weekends, it's a ghost town around there, not many things like restaurants, cafes or shops are open. I would stay north of the river around the Magnificent Mile, that is where al the ""hubub"" is. Rookie Mistake! As for the actual hotel, the room was tiny (not surprised). If you check into a W dont expect a spacious room. The washroom amenties were top notch, and of course the Bed was Heavenly. The rooms were very chic, but the walls are paper thin, nothing more pleasant than hearing the person in the next room going to the washroom. The concierge staff at the hotel was below average. I always felt like they had no clue. Either that, or they couldn't be bothered to make an effort. The front desk staff were excellent. They were very helpful and friendly. If not for them, I would have downgraded the hotel. The restaurant at the Hotel was disguisting. The food was brutal and the service was even worse. I don't ask for much, but when I say Thank-you please acknowledge me. When I ask for some water, please acknowledge me. When I am ordering from the menu please look at me. The lobby is one of the coolest places. The design and ambience is very funky. It's kind neat checking into a room and having people ordering martini's a few steps away. Whiskey Blue is a fun place to hang out, as well. Overall, I don't think I'd come back.

They have nice cushy bathrobes and nice smelling lotions and shampoos--good quality ones that you wish were a take home size! The only annoyance was that eventually at night the room overheated to feel like a sauna. And because the windows couldn't open I had to turn on the A/C to balance out the Mojave Desert.

As for the ammenties, the hotel has a gym and spa services. Indigo isn't stingy about towels either, which is a star in itself. I also liked that there were video games, and the tv remote was a Nintendo controller. The staff was nice, but the garage (owned by the city) is run by a real asshat, and it was 30 something a day for the PRIVILEGE, plus they demand you valet. BAH!

A happy chance meeting for me. I'd stay here again. If you're looking for a shiny modern-contemporary boutique hotel experience, this isn't it. Whitehall has a more comfortable, traditional vibe that wouldn't be hurt by a little updating -- perhaps an interior paint job, some more modern lighting. But don't be put off by the lobby area (rather dark and fusty) as the rooms are much nicer. The staff I dealt with was friendly and helpful (walking maps, suggestions, taxi-hailing). Although I'd reserved a king they offered to switch me to a larger corner room with two queens so I could enjoy a view. Glad I agreed, for two reasons: 1) the view; 2) with two beds in the room it meant I could do one of my favorite things to do when traveling & staying alone in a hotel - build a big downy bed-cocoon in one bed using the pillows and comforter from the second.  And honestly....The beds. ROCKED. Their matresses have some sort of brand name like 'Hypnose' or 'Hypnotic' or something like that, and they were. The pillows were perfect, the comforter was light and downy, and the high-thread count sheets slid against my skin like, well, high-thread count sheets. I don't usually sleep well in unfamiliar surroundings on the first night, but I did here -- thanks to my high-thread count bed cocoon and the perfectly quiet environment (I was on the 15th floor, which might account for the silence). The bathroom was dandy, the complimentary robes delightful, and the view charming. After getting back around 10:30 or so from my biz-event on Friday night I did find myself wishing they had 24-7 room service of some sort. I was hungry and tired but had to wander down to the attached restaurant, Fornetto Mei, to try and snag something to bring back to my room before the restaurant closed...and it was about to, so mine was the last order of the evening. Ended up getting a room temp pizza that was just 'meh.' The Whitehall's location is superb, particularly if you're like me and you decide at the last minute that you don't want to wear what you brought to wear to the event you have to be at in three hours. I just strolled across the street to the shopping plaza that houses Bloomies, Banana Republic, a freshly opened Karen Millen boutique, JCrew, etc. etc., and had a mini shopping spree. Lots of other posh, high-end boutiques in the area too if you're staying at the Four Seasons and have the matching bank account. * Fun Factoid? (I should probably look this up before spreading potential misinfo...too lazy)  Someone at my biz event told me the Whitehall was famous as the hotel the Rolling Stones used to stay in and, presumably, party in and otherwise generally act like the Rolling Stones in, back in the day.

So of course Hotwire was running some deal, where you could get a fight and a room at the Allerton for some really ridiculously low rate. So rather than booking directly through the Hotel, my out of town relatives booked through Hotwire. Knowing this, I called my contact at the hotel who will be called ""MK"" in this review and added everyone to the list. I spent a significant amount of time on the phone with MK so that everyone that was checking in would get the out of town bag etc. So when check in date came along, I was told by my mother-in-law that no one was getting bags!!! As you can imagine this is the LAST thing I wanted to deal with after having spent HOURS on the phone with MK and being charged $3 bucks a bag so they could sit there and not be distributed. I had to call the hotel after my rehearsal to iron out the issues. It appears that MK left no list at the check in counter and no one knew what to do, even though I had dropped off 20 bags to be given out. The best part is that I was still charged for ""distribution"" after having gone through this pain in rear experience. MK was less that pleasant to deal with, so please be cautious if you are ever considering a room block here. Be prepared to make phone calls and supervise the night before your wedding.

The flow of the meeting space is horribly designed. I then asked for help from employees who could not help me. To top it off apparently some elevators go to a certain floor and I got mixed up there too. The rooms were too small for my liking and I heard they finished renovating... hmmm I think they need to start over. My lasting moment was meeting their GM, Edward Andrews. Best words to describe him is rude and sloppy. How in the world he got his position is beyond me.

Well, look at the conference schedule for Chicago first before looking into booking this hotel! I really wish I would have done this - I think it would have made our wedding experience at The James so much better My overall impression of The James, after hosting our October wedding (which mind you was on a Sunday) here is that they are out to make money. Conferences obviously bring a larger profit for a hotel than a wedding does. The American Association of Opthamalogy's annual conference was in town over our wedding weekend, and The James did its best to accomodate conference goers with rooms before our out-of-town guests. And they were more concerned with the set-up of their events in the hotel over our wedding weekend than they were with ours. Our rehearsal was dreadful! They wouldn't let us use the room where we were hosting our ceremony/reception for our rehearsal because the conference was hosting a meeting! Obviously a conference meeting is so much more important than someone's wedding day?! We had to hold our rehearsal in this tiny side-room, and it really made the next day stressful and awkward because no one knew where to stand during the ceremony! The wedding coordinator also insisted on showing us how to cut the cake at our reception, so many of our pictures of this moment from our wedding have this person in them. Seriously, we can figure out how to cute our down cake, we didn't need this person micromanaging. They also screwed up my gift to my parents. I called them and emailed them ahead of time about having them put my parent's hotel rooms for the weekend on our bill, and they couldn't even do this right! They ended up charging my parents instead of me, and to make things worse they charged their wrong credit card and it caused a huge mess with the bank on their end. Seriously, what kind of people do they have working at the front desk? My final rant about The James was how slow communciation was during the entire planning process. They would take weeks to get back to our emails and sometimes we had to stalk them to answer our questions by calling them! And we couldn't book our band until the last minute because they took forever to get back to us regarding our sound equipment questions. The whole experience wasn't all bad though - the James did surprise us by letting us use one of their penthouse rooms for the weekend. It is a gorgeous space! It was really fun for my bridesmaids and I to use this to get ready the morning and it made for great photos! Our guests did love the food and the space - we received nothing but compliments on how great the day was and how much fun they had! I just wish everything wasn't so stressful leading up to the actually wedding!

We had to wait about 15 minutes to check in as there was one person working the front desk who was on the phone, this was at 2:45pm, check in is 3pm so we were a little early but I think you would have more staff on since it was a Friday. But we got checked in and headed to the elevator, two of us fit with our one suitcase each, barely. Not a big deal.  We get to the room and our room keys don't work. Ok it happens, the maid was able to let us in. We went to the desk and got new keys, which also didn't work. At this point we're irritated. So we call the front desk, who seems to think that not having a working room key isn't a big deal. Wow. I was not about to rely on them to let me in and out of the room. I did pay to stay here. So the maintenance man comes up tries to fix it, takes about 30-45 minutes and another set of keys but we're finally in business.  So lets talk about the room. Two of the lamps bulbs were burnt out. The doors on the cabinet for the tv were nearly falling off. The vanity lamp in the bathroom falling off if you wanted to actually move it and use it. Air conditioning didn't work properly. It was either, no joke, 60 degrees or 85. So that I was either freezing cold under a blanket or sweating. And during the night, the air just wouldn't turn on at all so it got even hotter. The walls are incredibly thin so you can here everything and everyone.  The toilets have the loudest sound when flushed. So imagine sleeping at being startled awake by the person flushing their toilet next door.  The decor is old which is the style of the hotel. The room itself wasn't in poor condition just a few things here and there. There was a random beark skin blanket on the bed? Not sure why since it didn't match the victorian decor at all. The bed was comfy and the pillows. Which is always a plus except when you can't get a good nights sleep because you're woken so much thru the night. The room wasn't huge, standard size room, but had a nice full length mirror on the closet doors. Lighting wasn't the best, I can't imagine the two other lamps would have shed much more light. The bathroom was fairly lit and decent in size. Parking is $48 for valet for one night or $40 for the garage right across the street. So pretty average there. I wouldn't stay here again, there are other hotels in the same price range that are nicer.

This is the second BW I stayed in since the first one was in Charleston in southern IL and even they were the same way college students renting rooms and just being an overall disturbance. Because it was new years the pre and post drunken behavior is a given especially for those who don't have much in the way of being considerate of other guests who would like to have some peace and quiet. The hotel should make college students sign waivers so they're put on notice about being asked to leave if they're being disruptive and disturbing other guests and destroying hotel property. Not to mention the train going by every 10 mins which makes it hard to sleep at night. Breakfast was mediocre it could have offered healthy choices like egg whites and skim milk. Not to mention it was rather weird to have some homeless guy saluting buses as they passed on the street and harassing pedestrians as they walked down the street and then dancing in front of the window as me and my boyfriend ate breakfast.

Cute Boutique Hotel Location: Great location near the River and 3 blocks from Michigan behind the new Trump Tower. I walked everywhere from up and down Michigan toward the Loop and Mill. Park.  Check In: I flew in early on Sat morning and my mother flew in that morning too, as we were coming from different cities. She arrived at the hotel about 9am. I really didn't expect to check in but at least hold our bags there and give us a place to meet up. Mother called me and said the lady at the desk said she could check in if her name was on the reservation. I called when I landed and spoke to the front desk and gave them the OK to let mom check in. VERY NICE of them to let us check in at 9am!! I arrived and preceded up to the room.  Room: The original Room they let my mother check into was not the Corner King we had booked. It was fine, and very nice of them to let us check in that early, but I had paid more for the upgrade. So I went down to the desk and asked the lady if there was a corner king available? If not, not a big deal as long as she could credit me the difference in price for the room. They ended up giving us a Corner King that was nice. It was not available until later so they let us keep our stuff in the other room, while we went out for the day, and then upgraded us when we returned from shopping. The Corner King was nice. Extremely comfortable beds, the windows around the whole room were nice, but a lot to close up at night. Nice views, much better than the original room where we looked into another building. I will say other than the corridor where you walked into the room, space wise it wasn't that much different than the original room. Not really worth the upgrade unless you want the better view and all the natural light. Breakfast and the Happy hour was a great touch. Fruit and bagels for breakfast with your choices of juices, coffee, and tea. nothing special but perfect for us. The Free Happy Hour was very nice - they had Sky and Belvedere Vodka, Jim Beam, Captain Morgan, and others. White and Red wines and a couple Italian beer selections. Nice little apps too. anti-pasta setup, cheeses, and breads. Service - lightbulb was out in the room and I called and someone came up in 5 minutes and replaced it. We did receive turndown service the 2nd night and they left a chocolate on the pillow, very nice. Lobby isn't anything much, but why do you need it to be.....

But, I feel like for the type of hotel it is, the service should be better.  My husband and I stayed here in the middle of our honeymoon. We were on an ""adventure"" honeymoon and had been camping through all the national parks in the West before coming to Chicago--and of course splurging on a nice hotel because it was our honeymoon! Is it because I rolled up in my dirty honda civic that was extremely full and had bikes on the back that made them think that they didn't need to be helpful? Someone did take my suitcases, but then afterwards didn't really help me out. Since he seemed to disappear, I ended up just taking them myself because he just left them on the corner of the sidewalk.  The concierge and the front desk were very nice and helpful about what to do in the area, although we couldn't get any kind of upgrades (like so many I hear about) for being on our honeymoon. I didn't necessarily expect that, but was hoping. The view from our room was beautiful still--view of Lake Michigan. The bed was super amazing and comfy.  When we were leaving and the valet brought my car around, I talked to the guy driving it and tipped him. Got in the car and saw that a plant I had brought with me was completely tipped over. There was soil all over the passenger side floor and the plant was uprooted. I know, it's weird to bring a house plant on a trip with you. But the fact is that it was there and it was totally a mess.... The driver could have at least told me when I was talking with him.... did he not notice the soil everywhere?? To be fair, there happened to be one guy that noticed I was upset about it. He took my floor mat, shook it out, and helped me get everything back together. He was SUPER nice. I wish I knew his name, because he seemed to be the only one that cared.  I know my complaints seem picky, but the fact is we don't splurge on expensive hotels that often, so I was expecting a bit more. No one really seemed to go out of their way. (on our wedding night we stayed at the Boston Harbor Hotel which DID go above and beyond) The hotel was gorgeous and comfortable, but the service wasn't really what I was expecting. Maybe when I'm older and better dressed?

The sad part is that the owners of Hyatt live in Chicago, so you'd think they would put more effort into this property but we have nicer Hyatt's in Colorado. I've stayed in a lot of the hotels around Michigan Ave and usually don't feel the need to write a review but last night's stay was ridiculous. The weather has been pretty brutal in Chicago and my apartment does not have central air, so I thought I would treat myself to a hotel for the night. Well I used Hotwire hoping I would get anything but this place, but that did not happen. I showed up around midnight because my girlfriend and I had been to the movies. Now I find sometimes if you get a really laid back night shift crew, they won't make you put down a credit card. I mean it's already midnight and checkout is at noon, why fill out more paperwork and hassle me with having to check that the ""authorization"" drops off. Well I guess this place thinks they're the W because they would not budge on a $50 authorization. $50 bucks!!! Even if I rockstar trashed the room, I'm so sure the $50 would cover it all. Oh well I let them authorize for $50 even though my room was pre-paid and then got offered a queen bed. Not okay. I can sleep on a king at home, I'm not paying to sleep on a queen. We finally compromise with a king on a smoking floor. I then asked if they knew of any late-night delivery open because I did not have my laptop to Grubhub something. The dude hands me a Sarpino's menu. WOW! The room was just what I had expected. Paper thin walls, rock hard bed and no wine glasses(just paper cups). Yeah, we got the longest bar in the country and you can't put real glasses in the room. To top it off, housekeeping woke me up at noon even though the privacy sign was up and the front desk said if I wanted to stay till 3 PM it would be 1/2 a night in price. No thank you! Do yourself a favor and skip on this place. The W, the Dana and even the Hotel Felix are better than this dump.

My fiance had called in and put in a special request and they said they would honor it. We ended up in a smoking room, and then we ended up with two full beds. Oh how romantic. Not only that, for the four days we were there, the rooms were rarely made before three pm. We have since stayed at the Westin across from the House of Blues.

Rooms have also been updated, and I'm sure there is a premium for a lake or Michigan Avenue view. Probably not for the wall view I got! Beds super cushy comfy with tons of pillows, key. Reception was more than cool with my request to extend checkout until 2:00 p.m. and no housekeeping knocking on my door (a pet peeve). Went to a large event here and the catering and event department did a great job.

Started off hot, now desperate to make a buck. First, when you arrive, if you don't want to valet your car, then don't drive up to the club on Sangamon. It's a narrow street in the warehouse district with delivery trucks on all sides, making it nearly impossible to turn around. Secondly, after security pats the guys down, you'll be paying a $20 charge. I came here with a birthday party, and they ""had no record"" of the party, yet the other people who got there before me didn't pay. Hmm. Victor Hotel conveniently has an ATM. This machine also charges you $4.50 per transaction when you withdraw the $20 needed for cover. Seriously, like other reviewers said, this is Chicago. If I am going to a club that makes you wait in line and charges $20, it better be amazing. Instead, $20 gets you what looks like a garage with strobe lights. The sound system is pretty poor here as well. Stand too far back, and you won't hear much. Stand moderately close to the DJ booth and your ears will ring for two days.

I'm not sure if the rooms have been redone recently or not, or if the motor lodge that others have reviewed is a totally different section. From my understanding, however, my friend did stay in the motor inn section. The room was pretty modern, with a flat screen TV, kitchenette, and a pretty nice bathroom when compared with your average motel-type rooms. We were both believing he would be staying in the main hotel, yet were both somewhat impressed by the room, which he described as ""artsy"". For the price, the room was great. I'm not sure if his price was lower because he placed his reservation online or not, but it was a pretty sweet deal. The room had two beds, a table with four chairs, a flat panel TV, a kitchenette with coffee maker and comp coffee, dishes, silverware, microwave, mini frig, and cabinets. The room had a little hallway which led to both the closet and bathroom. There's no dresser in the room, but a wall with drawers in the back of this little hall. The closet has more than ample space, plus two extra pillows, two extra blankets, iron, full sized ironing board, an extra roll of toilet tissue, and plenty of towels is the bathroom. The only ""bad"" thing was that I saw no ice machine anywhere. There was however a soda machine outside. The beds were fairly comfortable as far as motel beds go, and he had no problems with anything in the room, aside from the wifi being slow. Everything worked, the front desk staff was incredibly helpful, and everything was just great. I've stayed in a few motels, as well has motels pretending to be hotels, and this is by far my favorite. The next time I want to just get away for the weekend, it's nice to know that I don't have to leave the state or even Oak Park, to find a nice, relaxing hotel at a fair price for a night or two.

The CTA is close by as are other public transportation. VERY comfy beds, robes were provided, as well as a very efficient blowdryer. Only complaint was that like most buildings in colder climes, the heat was very high and we could not figure out how to turn down the radiator. Fortunately, the windows opened so we got some fresh air. Given the small amount of time we actually spent in the room, we didn't bother calling down to ask about the heat, but I'm sure they would have responded right away, just like they did to all our requests. We checked out 2/15 and stayed with a friend for 2 more days, then went home. That's when I realized I'd forgotten a favorite sweatshirt! Called the day I got home, 2/17, and spoke with Maria.

We'd tried to ask questions about the menu and the wines, but he mumbled so, that even upon asking him again, we still couldn't understand him.

I booked a group of my employees in there for a mini-conference. All loved their rooms, and there were no problems with our meeting room. The hotel bar worked excellently as a place to stop in for a nightcap, and everyone's room had a mini-bar. The hotel does want an exorbitant fee for internet access from a meeting room. That was a disappointment in this age of free wifi at every coffee shop in town. Even a modest fee would have been fine, but they wanted $400 (per day) for six of us to be able to connect to the wifi. (We got online via the hotel's free lobby wifi instead.)

He ended up paying with his frequent flyer miles which was good because apparently this place costs a mint. Good:  Beds. They are amazingly fantastic. I haven't had that good of a night's sleep since.  Water. The showers are awesome and the bath room pretty cool. TV. Great HD tv with this hypnotic trace music set to soothing visuals when you first turn it on. Bartender. The upstairs bartender was possibly the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.  Bad: Pretentious. Pretentious. Pretentious. They turn the lobby into a mock night club with a live DJ at night. If you're not wearing clothes they consider appropriate, you'll be asked to leave. Its a god damned hotel lobby?!?!?! Are you kidding me? As a guest, I should not feel awkward about being in the lobby of the hotel I'm staying at. Not only that, but the bouncer was incredibly rude about it. Saying anything like, ""We get sports and movie stars in here all the time and they can't wear their hats either."" is not cool what so ever. You're a bouncer. . . GFY. Generally the staff did not look interested in being helpful and had more important things to do than express interest looking after this guest. Don't judge a book by its cover people. . . Funny Anecdote- As I was leaving, I noticed a huge tour bus parked outside. I didn't think anything of it until I got a call from my buddy. Apparently I was leaving just as Snoop and 50 Cent were on their way in. If I had known that, I would have stayed another night. . . I'll give'em that as a plus.

I was quite impressed with how modern this place was considering the exterior and my previous experience with the Congress Hotel just down the street. The staff was very polite and bent over backwards to make sure I got a view of my favorite city. The lovely concierge even told me I could come back down for another room if the view wasn't to my liking. +1 you lovely concierge! My room was very trendy and up to date with modern fixtures and very clever use of space. Chicago has itty bitty hotel rooms in the older buildings but the Essex does a great job of utilizing what it has and the ceilings are tall enough that I can continue my tradition of jumping on the bed to christen the room. I love the view of the city from my room, the fantastic water pressure, the peace and quiet I get in my room and the awesome feel I get when I walk down the hallway. I feel like I'm in Quentin Tarantino's ""Four Rooms"" and feel glamorous when I spin around in the halls, the beautiful pool and my room. The best part is that they're close to public transportation if you're not the rental car kind of person, a Jewel-Osco, and a CARIBOU COFFEE! Ah, Chicago...how I've missed you.

My check in was quick and I got some extra amenities for being a Starwood member. Rooms are fairly spacious, clean, and I enjoy their beds and linens. I would suggest placing the ""do not disturb"" sign up if you're not an early riser. I forgot to do so two mornings in a row and I had housekeeping knocking at 7:30am (that's 5:30am PST for me so I was a grumpy face). Their meeting rooms are average but were ALWAYS freezing. However, they quickly came in to adjust the thermostat every time we called. I also don't know if it's because Chicago is such a high union-based city but the rates and charges for the meetings services were MUCH higher than other cities I've worked in. Note to self, budget wisely. This Sheraton has a great location and beautiful views. Their Chi-Bar had tasty cocktails and somewhat of a swanky decor. Overall, I look forward to coming back in March for our event. Let's hope the weather is on our side! :) 3.5 Stars

There are vacant lots on three out of four sides. There are no businesses within walking distance in any direction. There is no pedestrian traffic outside at any hour. If you don't believe us, check out Google Street View for this block. It gives you a VERY accurate sense of what this neighborhood is like. The people who work at this hotel seem to fall into two categories: rude+incompetent and nice+overworked+incompetent. The woman who checked us in when we first arrived was screaming at one of the hotel guests on the phone so loudly that it could be heard throughout the first floor. (She seemed to be trying to convey to them that their pizza had arrived. Why this required screaming we're not sure, but the tone she took with them was more than a little inappropriate.) The internet didn't work. Neither the ethernet nor the Wi-Fi. Their website advertises that they have free internet in ALL rooms. It was one of the main reasons we chose this hotel since we were here on business and needed it for work . We called down to see if they could resolve the issue. The woman at the front desk said, ""I'm not IT and it's a free service."" At $109/night (still overpriced ""discount"" travelocity rate) we did not think any of the very basic amenities could reasonably be considered ""free""; I mean, the bed was free too, right? Needless to say she did not resolve the issue, although the next night someone else at the front desk was kind enough to let us test other rooms. Dragging our computers with us from one floor to the next, we tried three separate rooms before we found one where the internet actually worked. We then repacked all of our stuff and switched rooms. When we came back the next evening we were locked out of our new room for some reason and had to go to the front desk to get our keycards reactivated. Apparently this had happened to several other guests as well. So how is the rest of the hotel? One word comes to mind: basic. Industrial-pile carpeting, hard and horribly uncomfortable mattresses that seem to be covered with some sort of plastic underneath very starchy and coarse sheets, lousy water pressure, no place to put your stuff in the bathroom, no full length mirror. We didn't have a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign in our room so housekeeping woke us up at 8:50 am on a Sunday morning. When we sent them away so that we could get dressed before they did up the room, they never came back and consequently we had to do without towels that day. There was such a disconnect between what we experienced with this hotel and what we'd read in some of the reviews that we wondered if maybe people had gotten it confused with some other hotel. The best thing about this hotel by far is the parking. The parking is free and convenient. There are pretty much always spots available. Other than that...

I love the new decor, and the location is great. Front desk staff is always friendly and helpful. Valet's good too - there was this guy Chuck at the valet when I stayed here a few months ago and he was just the nicest guy. Haven't seen him the last 2 times I stayed here though. Also ordered room service for breakfast once and it was great. Like others have mentioned, the rooms (and sinks and closets) are definitely smaller, but in my opinion they're enough for 2. I've stayed here with my partner for over a week before and we had everything we needed (although a microwave would have been nice). It just sort of feels like living in New York, you have to be neat and make sure every space is being used. I've also stayed at the King suite before - nice separate living room space, but you can only sleep 1 comfortably on the sofa bed. My friends opted to lay the pillows on the floor and slept on the floor instead. I get the feeling that the hotel doesn't have all its processes down yet. Sometimes I make requests (such as pillows or pet bowls) and they take a long time to be fulfilled. Sometimes it takes multiple reminders, and sometimes it takes me to be proactive by going downstairs to the front desk. They certainly seem to be improving everytime I stay here though. and if anything does go wrong, the staff does its best to remediate the issue, an effort which I am appreciative of. My biggest issue with the hotel is its thin walls. Of my stays here, I've heard neighbors' passionate nights to phone conversations, and I'm not even a light sleeper. My worst experience was when my neighbor decided to wake up to Josh Groban 45 minutes before I wanted to wake up. An unfortunate incident likely resulting from being in an older building, but somehow I still like this hotel a whole lot and keep going back. I now request for quiet rooms in my Kimpton profile, and it seems to have helped in my most recent stay.

It's a sketchy part of town, with Chinatown about 4-5 blocks away and the nearest L station about 6-7 blocks away... and I can honestly say these are LONG blocks. If you plan on staying out late in the city after dark, you're probably safe taking a cab. It can be pricey though, so taking a more expensive hotel farther up north... especially north of the loop is better. Room service is non-existent... although the hotel does advertise a pizza place and chinese place that you and order delivery from. The hotel's little sports bar is its only saving grace. The crowd is upbeat and the drinks are great. If you're new to the city and aren't street smart, this isn't the best place to stay. If you've been here before and are used to far south of the loop, it's definitely worth it!

The hotel has very different vibe - dark, yet lit here and there with a strange mix of futuristic and hip elements. The front check in desk glows with a pink-ish light as you approach. The elevators have a wild 3D-ish material on the walls. The room was on the 6th floor - and somewhat small - very clean and modern. The desk felt like it belonged on The Jetsons. The bed has a night light system beneath the bed - so it sort of glows. Their was a flat panel HD screen mounted on the wall - BUT no HD channels. The bathroom in my room was tiny. But clean, well maintained, and serviceable. The big fail for the room was the AC unit. It was rather stuffy when I arrived. I turned on the AC and it never really cooled off - it just blew air the entire time. I advised the front desk at check out about the AC unit. The hotel staff were friendly and personable. The evening I arrived the Concierge advised me on eating establishments with walking distance. Beware: If you arrive on a Sunday and need to get to a Drug Store - please note you are in downtown Chicago - all Drug Stores around the hotel are closed. I ended up walking a very long seven or so blocks to a 24 hour Walgreens down off of South Halstead Street. There is a McDonald's next door, a Starbucks across one street, and a Dunkin' Donuts catty corner across the intersection - so you do have alternative breakfast options if you don't want to opt for the rather pricy hotel breakfasts in their restaurant. If it weren't for the AC problem - I'd give the place at least 4 stars. I'd stay here again.

Clean, but tiny. Elevator pretty much only fits two people plus luggage. We got a room that didn't face the El line, but my mom said that she could still hear it at night when she was trying to sleep (I didn't hear a thing, but I slept through Hurricane Wilma in FL four years ago, so that should tell you how heavy of a sleeper I am).Water pressure in the shower was fantastic, even if the bathroom itself was on the smallish side. Beds were EXTREMELY comfortable. Breakfast in the morning was ample, free cookies in the afternoon and right across from a Jamba Juice. You really can't lose.

It was on a recommended hotel list by family of friends who were hosting a wedding outside of town. So glad we picked this place from the list! This hotel is definitely more bang for your buck than most of the hotels in the area that I was also researching. To tip the scales even more in the right direction of price, we booked our stay with a ""Chi-Town City Escape Package"" that the hotel was promoting (now until 9/5/11) and they give... yes give you a $50 gift card + $20 food voucher per day. SCORE!!! Upon check-in, we were handed the gift card. I had to ask about the voucher process a few times, but I finally cleared it up with a staff member in the know and they said the per day food voucher total would be deducted from any food and beverage charges (room service or restaurant dine in) from your final bill. SWEET! * Really friendly staff and speedy check-in. * Our room was really spacious and looked recently remodeled. * Excellent location and views from the higher floors. * They have HBO. * The Keurig coffee maker is a plus! * No pool, but you're a couple blocks away from Mag Mile -- go shop instead! * There was no fridge, but we also didn't think we could ask for one so we didn't. * The AC was a little warmer than we like and there seemed to be no thermostat control, but it sufficed considering it was a muggy 80+ degrees outside the few days we were in town. * Big bathroom, but the tub had seen better days and didn't drain too well. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to be in the middle of everything and have close access to public transportation.

That was the best part of this place. I'd second a lot of the other comments although I'm not sure why the ratings were otherwise so high. The rate was good for a hotel in a good location in Chicago. I had a decent sized suite with really all the amenities you'd expect in a hotel - including a safe, which I feel is a rare find these days. The bad: The train is an issue. We were on the 5th floor facing the train. It was loud enough to be annoying, but really did not keep me up. I could see it being a huge problem in 3rd floor rooms. The bed and mattress were old and creaky, and the room was really dry, so I really didn't get a good night sleep either night I was there. Finally, there was absolutely no style. It was all beige, tan, and lightly stained wood with Target-esque faux modern light fixtures. Blah.

The staff at The Drake treat their guests like royalty and, with the beautiful lobby and glamorous history, you will feel like royalty as well. My mom and I stayed here last summer in one of the suites. However, they had overbooked that night and ended up having to place us in a smoking wing. My mom is extremely sensitive to smoke smell and I don't care for it either. Unfortunately, there was nothing they could do about it so they upgraded our room. The suite we ended up getting was beautiful-- it was a corner room so it was bigger than most and had a wonderful view of the lake. We actually witnessed a tornado by watching it sweep across the lake from the safety of our room. I'm a big fan of historic buildings and luxurious and over-the-top decor. Give me blood red velvet curtains and gold embossed leather walls and I'm a happy woman. So you can see why I was so impressed with The Drake. The clientele this hotel attracts is equally impressive. I was in the tea room the same day a woman was throwing her bridal shower there. When I went to the powder room (really, ""bathroom"" doesn't do it justice), I overheard the woman crying about a lost diamond ring and her friends trying to convince her it's not a big deal at all. You can bet I was on the floor looking for it. The Drake is a wonderful place to stay if you're on a vacation that you want to make extra glamorous, decadent or special. On that same note, I wouldn't recommend it to business travelers as there are no office-type amenities and, while the service is great, the staff tend to take their time.

Even if they thought we were, when your guest pays that kind of money, you just say you will send someone right up. As it turned out, the TV was broken.

We checked out a number of historic hotels downtown and left each one feeling pretty ""meh.""

The ballroom is gorgeous and was perfect for our 150-person wedding. It's modern, but with many historic touches, and we loved the urban feel of having the L go by the ballroom windows during the evening reception (but you absolutely couldn't hear the train). And we got so many compliments from our guests on the food. We didn't hire a wedding coordinator, and yet every part of our wedding went off without a hitch thanks to the amazing Allegro staff. From the doormen to the bellhops to the desk staff, I have never met a friendlier and more helpful group of hotel employees. The catering/event staff in particular made the entire experience painless. My feelings were reaffirmed when my husband and I came back to the Allegro to reshoot our wedding photos recently. Shortly after our wedding, we found out our photographer had lost our wedding photos (wedding tip: when researching photographers, ask them how and when they back up their photos). We decided to throw on the ol' tux and white dress and take some new photos with a new photographer, and when I contacted catering managers Kerry and Alyssa they couldn't have been more sympathetic or helpful. When we came by to retake the photos they surprised us with the hospitality suite for the afternoon (easily one of the coolest hotel rooms in the city) and a bottle of bubbly. We got some great photos in the suite, lobby and ballroom. Kerry and Alyssa really helped make an unfortunate situation fun and memorable -- four whole months after our event.

I'm sure this is an old building but you wouldn't know it by the looks. I was super happy to find I could strut around my room in a cheetah, yes CHEETAH robe while my man wore his zebra robe. These are also available for sale along with a set of cheetah PJs (his and hers) and some cozy socks which were in our closet, just in case. The mini bar is extensively stocked with not only beverage and snacks but also things you may need like toothbrushes, razors and even a ""love kit"", all for purchase if needed. These items were quality brands and eco-friendly in most cases which was nice. The shampoo and lotions were Aveda which also made me happy, they just smell great and have great products. I actually liked their towels, most hotels even some of the better ones have inconsistent and possibly scratchy towels that make you paranoid that you might get stuck with the itchy one. These were consistently plush and didn't reek of bleach. My only negative would be the lack of counter space in the bathroom. The chic table-top sink on a granite counter just doesn't lend enough space for your toiletries but we managed by shuffling the hotels accessories around and using the back of the toilet. I must give kudos to the front desk for upgrading our room to a slightly larger room for free, we booked as a package deal on Orbitz. We tried to purchase an upgrade for the jet tub room but they didn't have any available. Didn't eat there so I can't speak to that, but the area is in the theatre district and close to some good eats. We also had a great corner view room and could see straight down one of the streets (??) and not just at a window of another building which is often your view in a big city. Great hotel, great service, helpful nice people, elevators were fast. I'd go again!

Also, there were several drop dead gorgeous black women working here. 2) The drinks were STRONG. Like scrunch up your face and make a noise strong. If you're gonna pay $10+ for a drink in my book, it better be strong. Sangria was tasty. 3) I dug the dcor. We checked out the upstairs/hotel check-in area. It was cool-swanky.

I'm a local- but I live in the burbs. I'm downtown for a conference and the hotel where the conference is was sold out, so I looked on TripAdvisor and Yelp to see about this hotel-- and wow!

Update: The bed, while roomy and with great sheets and pillows does NOT have a good mattress. Very old and stiff and creaky. Bummer. It was ok to sleep in but if they replaced the mattresses this would be perfecto! Now- I ordered breakfast this morning. I give it 2 stars. Mediocre-- not BAD mind you but nothing yummy.

The meal is completed with beautiful offerings from the pastry chef. You can also get champagne to compliment your meal and complete your outing. I love how accommodating and consistent the service is. Our pots were toped off with hot water frequently, the snacks were brought out almost immediately and the server was always around to answer questions and grab us anything we needed (and to take a picture of the mother daughter outing).

The parlor room was supposed to be ""better"" and have a bed that was ""closer to the ground"" (??) and they offered to discount my rate. Fine. I get to the room and my key doesn't work.

Why the charade? So this new room was fine. Of course, I had to move for the next two nights. To try to make up for the issue the first night, the next morning's manager promised that they had given me a ""really nice room"". It turned out to be a corner room with great views. But. The heater didn't work. (I didn't try to change rooms again.) After all that, when I was checking out, they had charged me the original rate for all three nights! The person checking me out asked how my stay was. I said, ""Well..."" and then they comped me for one night.

I was horrified to see that a hotel as glamorous as the Drake was using Priceline. To think that regular people could be walking on the same outdated carpets and watching the same so-90s TVs as Judy Garland or the English Royal Family at $100 per night made me not want to eat for the rest of the week. Lucky for me it was Ramadan. My two stays at the Drake have been like old-fashioned film noir love-making. The little sofas in the elevators are to die for. Who would ever think of putting sofas in their elevators? Even my luxurious condo in my homeland Dania Beach does not have sofas in the elevators. Ya, and for a building with Chanel on the ground floor, I think Coco would have a chemical reaction to some of the guest rooms. Go suite or go home. The regular guest rooms felt dark and dreary. Old-world style has been replaced for a reason. I think I've rennovated myself more times in the past six months than the Drake has since 1920. So why give 4 stars you say? hEllO, this one's easy: because the Drake isn't a hotel. It's a museum with cleverly-disguised bedrooms. Of course--because if you pay the same for the chic Swissotel down the street you can't say you walked on the same carpet as Prince Charles, or stood in the same lobby as Frank Sinatra. And why people complaining about internet?? Of cOUrsE they charge a lot for internet usage in your room, hEllO. Who goes to a museum and surfs the web? Not anyone I know. If you want to surf the web or stay in a ""hotel,"" then go to the Best Western in Lakeview. There is free internet and you're surrounded by gay people, all lovely, but you can't say that you slept in the same place as Frank Sinatra. Only his wife can say that, or people who have stayed at the Drake. I won't talk about the price of this museum because I don't like to talk about money. But if I did like to talk about money, I'd say that this museum's entrance fee is pricey on a per/night basis, but could you imagine how much the MoMa would fine you if they caught you sleeping overnight in the Marie-Josee and Henry Kravis Gallery?

We held our ceremony and reception at the hotel, since we had a decent number of out-of-town guests and I didn't want them to have to deal with driving. (And how awesome is it to be able to party all night and then just be a short elevator ride away from your room?) I know I'm a little bit biased, but my wedding was BEAUTIFUL. Everything turned out better than I ever could have hoped for. My vision for my wedding day was executed exactly; how many brides can say that? Annie Mammoser is the wedding coordinator at the hotel, and whatever they're paying her, I'm sure it's not enough, because she is amazing. Anything I wanted or needed, she was on it. She made sure all the little details were seen to........ I did not spend a single second worrying about anything on my wedding day. Even everything leading up to that (the tasting, meeting with linen rental vendor, multiple walk-throughs with my florist) was stress-free. The space is really beautiful (love the chandelier and the bar area), and it's nice to have it all to yourself (rather than being one of several weddings at a larger hotel or banquet hall). We took some beautiful pictures in front of the Marion Street entrance, and all the extra seating area made for a really fabulous cocktail hour. (The only thing I'm kind of bummed out about now is that I didn't get to have any of the awesome hors d'oeuvres we selected since I was so busy taking pictures and saying hi to everyone.) As far as cost goes - totally a bargain! 102 people for dinner, copious amounts of alcohol and hours of dancing cost us less than $10,000. Try doing that in downtown Chicago. (Not to mention the two complimentary nights in a suite that we were given. The room was amazing, and it was really nice to be comped like that.) I've now been married for a month, and my friends and family are still talking about the food (really, really delicious!), the candy buffet (set up by Annie, perfectly!), and how much fun they had (possibly due to 5 hours of open bar). A perfect setting for one of the best days of my life (so far).

Our server, who's name I really wish I could remember, took great care of us. I always ordered something from the nightly specials and it never disappointed...and he always suggested a great wine pairing. From the menu, we had the Beef Carpaccio one night, which was excellent. The best part of the stay, though, was the hotel itself. When I hear boutique hotels, I think small, but the rooms were excellent sized - bigger than the last Marriott I stayed at - and the bathroom is much nicer (and bigger) than the one at my house. Lots of marble, rich fabrics, pillows and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. Plenty of space for working. Warm and inviting - it was almost as nice as being at home. Reasonably priced for a downtown hotel, within walking distance to a few other restaurants, a Starbucks and my client's office. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat...

We had an amazing view of the city from our room, I couldnt stop looking out the window & actually slept with the windows open. The only reason I couldnt rate this hotel a 5star hotel. We encountered 2 problems. One of the 2 elevators stopped working so guests had to use either the 1 working elevator or the service elevator, which made length deliveries & things much longer. Also I have really sensitive skin & dont use the soaps provided by the hotel management, so I usually travel with my own soap, not thinking anyone would throw it away i left it in the shower, for the next time i use it. When we got back to our room after being out all day, I noticed our room was cleaned & my soap was gone & replaced with a brand new HOTEL BAR OF SOAP. Luckily we were close enough to everything, from downtown, millenium park & shopping..I was able to replace what they had thrown away...needless to say I didnt leave my soap in the shower in the next morning.

Although our view was directly of another building, we could still see Navy Pier and the Lake. Morning swim in the indoor pool and dip in a jacuzzi is the perfect way to start a Saturday or Sunday morning!!! The lobby is GORGEOUS!! I couldn't get enough of it! Intricate gold chain designs over mirrored walls with brick column type structures and delicate flowers atop low tables...haven't seen anything like it in Chi yet. The room felt very fresh and clean, loved the modern design of the bathroom...felt very European. Great service. Delicious food and drinks at Fellini.

Not much personality here.  Cleanliness: The hotel is clean, but looks too dark inside. Facility: The room we stayed in was just plain strange. It was long and narrow. The hot water for the tiny sink in the Bathroom, along with the shower was not consistent. The sink water never got warm enough and the shower water took forever to get warm. You can't watch the flat panel TV from any place in the room. You can't see it from the bed, even though they have it mounted on a swivel base up on the wall, it doesn't swivel enough. Not even close. There is no couch. You only get a fufu chair that is one of those long chairs and it's REALLY uncomfortable. As you walk into the room, there is only one tiny light in the ceiling. This makes the entire front part of the room too dark to be useful. The one saving grace for the room was the bed. It was great, along with the bath towels. The desk in the room (908) has broken leg tips. Those silly looking words printed inside the lamp shade and also in the wine shelf were just plain spooky. It made using those lights a no-go. There was a nice ice machine on this floor. The slide light controller for the lamp was lame. The elevators have sort of 3D images on each side of little round objects. It's not good to place 3D in transportation devices that go up and down. This makes some guests dizzy. You have to navigate through a narrow corridor in the Lobby because they have places for people to sit and drink as you attempt to leave the hotel. Overall Recommendation: This hotel is located near, well, nothing. A better choice would be the Intercontinental located on the Magnificent Mile. It has gobs of restaurants and movie theaters within walking distance.

I've become more discerning in deciding the important things in a hotel over the years I've been traveling. Where I used to prioritise a swimming pool and not swim, I now look for proximity to public transport and an internet connection. Seneca Suites is an older hotel reflected in its dark wooden decor but its location a block east of the Magnificent Mile is its outstanding feature. It's 4 blocks from the Chicago Red line station. My room was huge - separate bedroom, living room and kitchen. Teddy and I could almost have a room each! Although I ate out on this trip, the kitchen would certainly allow self catering to cut down on costs. I didn't suffer the problems mentioned in other reviews - the water was hot for my showers and the decor wasn't worn out. The free wifi was fast and reliable.

There is no reason to charge 25 bucks a night extra plus tax for an executive room and wifi and fitness equipment access when I can get free wifi at a holiday inn and use fitness equipment too. This was just a ripoff. Don't park at the hotel. There are several self pay places right behind the hotel. You can pay 45 bucks a day at the hotel, or you can pay 22 bucks a day. You choose. And it's a short block. I prepaid for the hotel via hotwire, but they still asked for a card for incidentals and put a $300 hold on it. They could have at least told me what they were doing when they were doing it. I found out in checking my balances online. The room was nice, but some things unnecessary. My room had a huge flat screen, two double beds, and two full bathrooms. We didn't really need two full bathrooms, though it's a unique touch. Newly renovated rooms. The metro train runs and is audible from the room. This might really bother some people, but it didn't bother me or my son. We sleep like rocks, and there's something about the sound of trains that I actually find kind of soothing. We are also night owls anyway, and the train stops running after like 2 or 3, so it didn't impede our sleep. The inside of the hotel is great. The place is is like a titanic ocean liner without the sinking. This is a grand dame hotel with a lot of history, celebrating its 85th year this year. I't's decorated very nicely. Presidents and celebrities have stayed here. The penthouse suites are something like 2700 square feet. It's a splurge place.  I got a lower price on hotwire. I think because it's so big (1544 rooms), they always have some rooms available and so need to go that route. I almost booked it on http://hotels.com, was thrilled to get it for much cheaper on hotwire, though the wifi/fitness equipment charge took away some of the discount (http://hotels.com had various packages that included different things such as parking or wifi, many different head spinning combinations to confound). Anyway, I think I still got a bargain. I'd recommend it to any first timer to Chicago, so they can have a grand experience. For subsequent visits to Chi-town, stay at a place that offers free wifi and free or more reasonable parking. But we really enjoy the grandness of it, and were happy to be there.

First, a member of the staff entered our room mid-day unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present. Not a tremendous problem, but when the young woman at the front desk replied ""What do you want me to do about it"" with the tone of a flippant teenager, I began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff. Fast forward to this evening. Following a lovely meal off the premises, we chose to turn in a bit early at 11:30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions, the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room. Acting prudently and with restraint, we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs, but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response. Sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel, and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume. On one hand I appreciated his honesty, but on the other, I truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property. Since we're out of options for the evening, we've decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being, but given the circumstances, the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession. Also, I was alarmed to learn that while I slept the prior night, a possible gang-related shooting took place mere blocks from the property. This wouldn't have been a concern if like nearby hotels, the Knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby. Would I stay here again? Maybe on a dare, or if someone else was footing the bill. Yet I've had better experiences in road side motels, and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests, and more importantly simple common sense.

I do appreciate their complimentary continental breakfast, which is available on every floor. The selection isn't mind-blowing or anything, but you can get baked goods and fresh fruit, which is all I really ask for. The best part is that I've never had to spend over $179/night on a stay here!

In another review I saw someone complain about a chair with stuffing spilling out. I don't know if I was in the same room, but I also had a chair with stuffing hanging out. However, the leather that the chair was covered with was amazing, I only sat in that chair. I don't blame them for not getting rid of it and I don't think that it could be repaired.

I went to talk to the front desk about it. I am a veteran of the Restaurant industry and I know that treating people badly never gets you what you want, so even when complaining I am always calm, polite, and patient. In discussing the issue with the front desk they were polite and attentive but ultimately treated me like I was stupid. Kept saying there was nothing they could do about canceling the hold, I would have to call my bank. In the end I realize that the issue resulted from my not being informed. At check in I signed a form, I asked to see a copy of that form, it clearly explained there would be a $125 hold placed for each day that I stayed. A little excessive if you ask me. But why couldn't the front desk just explain to me that that was hotel policy? I would have understood. Instead they acted like they had no idea, and claimed there was nothing they could do. I was there for two nights, and did not want to pay $30 for internet access, so I only signed on the one day. At check out I made it a point to mention that the only incidentals would be the one day of internet, and confirmed that the holds would be credited back to me less one day on internet. Then the front desk tells me the internet was complementary! WTF it would have been nice to know that when I checked in!!!!!!!!

I've heard of the Drake in movies, and have known some people that have stayed here, but I've never been here myself. And now that I have, anytime I'm invited I will be sure to show up. For a couple reasons. 1) Because you know that the food is going to be good. 2) Anytime you come here especially with a date or on a date I'm pretty sure you're gonna get some just based on general principal. 3) It actually feels good to go somewhere that you pass by so often on LSD, and that has so much historical significance. The restaurant inside is the famous Coq D'or. This is where Joe DiMaggio and Marylin Monroe carved their names into one of the booths. I came here for a little private wedding reception in room 550 which is the Princess Diana suite. And yes it does look fit for a princess. The view is out to lsd and the beach, and the bedroom is just about the same square footage as my last apartment. But when I think about if I would stay here... probably not. It's in an area where gucci and louis vitton are right across the street. So not only will it be a pretty penny, but it will also piss you off when you walk out the door and see an old couple expect you to wait in line behind them just because they have old money. So for the same price you will get a larger room at let's say the wit or the sofitel. But if you're in the area walk into the lobby and go back to the 50's and 60's.

I called 2 days after I had left, when I saw I left the shirt behind, and the lost and found said they could not find it. They did not take the description of the shirt down, all he wanted to know was what floor I was on, then proceeded to inform me that there were other shirts found but none matching my description. I got VERY frustrated and explained he never TOOK a description of the shirt, so then he asked what it looked like, waited 3 minutes and said ""No, no shirts like that were left behind"".

The view from the Sky Lounge on the 40th floor is breathtaking, and we enjoyed our breakfast there each morning before venturing out for the day, even the young ones thought it was cool. This hotel is in the heart of it all and within walking distance to great shopping, site seeing, and restaurants. I could go on and on but you really need to see it for yourself. If you go to Chicago stay at the Avenue Hotel! The Jones family will definitely be back.

If I hadn't called to fix this, they would have charged me for cancelling two rooms. The stay at the hotel was alright. The rooms were clean and very basic. The dinner downstairs was alright. The buffet wasn't very consistent. One beef dish was very bland, but the next batch they brought out was overwhelmingly filled with pepper corns. Like I stated earlier, I booked the rooms with my card. However, a different card by a different person was used to pay with it. I received copies of the receipt by email and my card number isn't listed whatsoever as the form of payment. Now, can you explain to me why I got charged $200 by the hotel? Never again.

Aside from the cramped arrangements, the hotel was excellent. The hotel bar was expensive (as is anything in the Loop), and the ceilings were pretty low. My only other gripe was that the door to the bathroom was a sliding door, and left a rather large and awkward open space between the panel and the wall. Other than that, the room and hotel itself were very nice, and the location was excellent - right across the street from The Drake and footsteps from Michigan Avenue.

I booked a 3 night Fri-Sun night stay at an incredible rate ($400 including all taxes), and the location was great. Valet'd the car, checked in, room was small but nice. Here's where the problems begin... The room was hot, 79 degrees. No worries, we were going to hit the town anyways. So we cranked it down to the minimum temperature allowed, 65, and went out. Returned several hours later, still hot. Maybe it didn't click on? Tried to re-set it but we ultimately ended up suffering through a sticky, sweaty night. This is when we noticed the unbelievably shitty quality of the bedding. Stiff, sandpaper-y, cheap. First thing in the morning, I notified the front desk that our AC might be broken. We went out and came back maybe 4-6 hours later to find that nothing had been done. When the maintenance guy finally came, he confirmed that it was broken and he called downstairs to get our room changed. Waited at least a 1/2 hour for a bellhop to come move our bags, never did. Called again and asked, still waiting...finally went down to the lobby and started to pitch a fit. Bellhop never came, so my boyfriend and the maintenance man dragged all of our bags down 2 floors. Room #2 smelled god awful as soon as we walked in. Some kind of chemical or moth ball smell. Had to argue with the hotel staff for a good 15 minutes about the smell before I finally went ballistic down in the lobby. NOW a manager intervenes... We got upgraded to a much bigger, nicer room on another floor. They also comp'd our valet parking, breakfast, and gave us a complimentary one night stay for a location closer to home on the East coast. Another manager saw us the next day and personally apologized, he did seem truly embarrassed.

All of a sudden things become more manageable. B) W's usually have nice gyms. C) W's usually have terrific locations. 3 years ago this one almost turned me off of W's forever. There but for the saving grace of the Lakeshore W - a truly wonderful, friendly home away from home ... However, I was recently in Chicago when the whole darn city seemed to be sold out. My only option was the City Center W. I prepared myself for a sour experience. To my surprise, they have brought things up a bit.

We stayed 4 nights during October 2011. *King Bed Suite: The rooms are clean, spacious and modern. I think this property may have had an update because the paint, furniture and dcor were in great condition. Our had room many electrical outlets, sofa, flat screen, microwave and mini refrigerator. Average size bathrooms with shower and tub. *Service/Hotel Amenities: The staff was friendly and helpful. No bellhop. Free wifi and breakfast daily. Parking available, but it's $36 a night :/ There is Cupcake shop and Argo Tea Shop in the lobby. *Location: Great location. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown, so there's pros and cons to its location. (The cons were very minimal) -Pros: Walking distance to El train, shops, drug stores and restaurants. 2 blocks away from Sears Tower! -Cons: Business close early. The scene is ""dead"" during evenings and weekends. Not many bars in the area. *Random Tips: -Giordanos' Pizza: 4 blocks away from the hotel. The lobby has Giordano's coupons. -Car Rental: isn't needed to explore Chicago, but if you do rent, there's an Enterprise located in the hotel parking structure. If you do a day rental, you can avoid the daily parking fee, by returning to car to Enterprise, since they are located in the same structure. -Take a Drive to Wisconsin: As a huge cheese lover, I was over the top giddy when I found out Wisconsin was only an hour away. We rented a car for a day and drove to explore Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The highway from Chicago to Milwaukee has many cheese themed shops and a shopping outlet with 5% sales tax! -Pet Friendly: Throughout my stay I saw a few people checking in with their pets.

Tea is nothing special - I can do pumpernickel bread with egg salad and sliced, cascaded strawberrys in my own house, and I am no Martha Stewart.

Now let's start there--before I opened the door. I went to the front desk and checked in, went up stairs to my room, which was not the room number they told me, it was a converted conference room of some sort that they didn't even bother to change the name to a number. I proceeded to call the front desk and let them know that my room did not exist, which is when they finally told me it was actually called ""study number 1"". Went to put my key card in and did not work, so I tried a few other times before I finally gave up and called the front desk again. They told me to try again in a couple of minutes and if it didn't work, to go downstairs and get a new card. Of course, I had to go and get a new card. So I go downstairs and wait in what seems like the longest line (which I know wasn't their fault but I was just annoyed) then got a new card and headed back upstairs. Guess what? It DOESN'T WORK... AGAIN! I call the front desk again and get an answer by an equally annoyed front desk person, who tells me that I must be doing something wrong because the room key works. How rude! Finally, a very nice employee comes in and tries to use my key, which does not work (thankyouverymuch front desk girl). He got it opened with his key and had to get me a copy similar to his key for the remainder of my stay.

There's also a restaurant and lounge with a nice bar that I wish I could've checked out! The staff was pretty friendly when I checked in and I headed to my room on the 11th floor. Let's just say I was shocked when I walked in... it was so small! Smaller than my bedroom in my apartment. Like... if I put the ironing board out, I couldn't really get anywhere. The bed was nice and the TV on the wall was big, and the bathroom was modern and impressive as well. This is pretty random but while I was in the shower (with glass doors), I could see through the window all down Michigan. Kinda cool! I noticed a spider web on the wall which was easy to spot in the clean, shiny bathroom, but I forgot about it... until later that night when I saw a spider crawling on it. SO gross... try getting a good night's sleep after that if you're someone who's as afraid of spiders as I am! Couple other things I wasn't a fan of: -No room service menu in my room even though there was supposed to be... had to look online. -Internet is $9.95 a day which didn't shock me (I've seen much worse in hotels) but it made me log in and accept the charge every time I opened my computer. -My breakfast (eggs, sausage, toast, fruit, coffee) was $52. I almost fainted when I saw that on my bill. -To valet your car overnight it's $50. FIFTY DOLLARS. Seriously? No matter how great the city is, I'm always going to think that's ridiculous. My car was with valet for eight hours overnight, and again, it was $50. -No cell phone reception in my room... text messages wouldn't even go through. -If anyone from the hotel is reading this, there's a drop of blood on the bathroom curtains in room 1108. I understand these hotels are designed for people with a lot of cash, but does that really make it right to charge so much for everything? I probably won't stay here again even though there were a few positives... I just feel like there are a lot better options at a similar price!

However, the woman at the front desk was able to find one room ready at that time (the other wasn't ready yet), which was fine by me! How wonderful! It was nice to freshen up and change before heading out to explore the city. The room was ginormous! My friend had told me the last she stayed there her room was tiny were small, so needless to say, I was thrilled when I walked in. There was enough space to waltz if you wanted to! Good bath products, excellent water pressure (that is so important to me). The beds were super comfy. For someone who doesn't normally sleep well to begin with - much less in a hotel - my head sank into the pillows and I fell asleep right away each night. Just a couple of negatives: cell phone service was very spotty in the hotel. In fact, I had no service at all when I was in the lobby. F&B service in the lobby wasn't great. We sat in one of the comfy chairs along the wall, hoping to have one last drink before we flew out that evening. There was a menu on our table so clearly they do service all the tables.

The walls and floors must be pretty thin, as I heard plenty of coughing and footsteps from above and next door. I would normally cover these sounds with the steady white noise of the fan, but the rattly fan was worse in this case.

I could literally hear the girls next door complaining about how some guy wasn't giving them any attention at the club - word for word. I dont wanna hear any conversations from next door when I want to fall asleep (after 1am?) especially when the going rate is $160+ a night. Oh, and I could clearly hear a couple having sex on another side of the room. Nice. (not really)  Advice to management: install more sound insulation between rooms. The Good: Service is friendly and attentive. The hotel provides free wine (to guests) in the lobby at 5pm. Nice.  There is a lounge called Encore on the first floor (didnt go, but it looks like a nice place to hangout for a drink). Hotel provides a nice breakfast every morning, including plenty ice water (with lemon) in the lobby and freshly-popped popcorn in the afternoons. Location is next to the Chicago theater district and is fairly close to all the tourist spots. For $160+ a night, I expected a little more. Not sure I will come back here, unless I get a great deal. For the most part, the hotel is fine, but dont expect a quiet space in your room. If you are looking for peace and tranquility, you may want to look elsewhere.

The food has always been good, and even though the place doesn't blow me away, the nice convenience of having it downtown is a plus. Every event I have attended is in the ballroom on the lobby floor, and although it is not a giant space, it has a great old school charm to it that many of the newer hotels do not have.

It's not at all unpleasant but you feel like you're in that awkward little place between old-fashioned charm and new-fanged snazz. In other words, just kinda dumpy. My cohort astutely pointed out that the complimentary bar snack was the exact same cheesy pretzel mix that that have at our local VFW Hall. Plus or minus? You decide! The bartender may have been the best part of the bar. When we enquired as to what the large room was up on the mezzanine level he replied (in the friendliest way possible) that we were just looking it a series of mirrors meant to make the room look larger. Nice trompe 'l'oeil, Knickerbocker. He was friendly, chatty and seemed slightly crestfallen when we asked for the check after only one round. Sorry Martini Bar, we have Chicago Fizzes to drink and toasted almonds to eat up the road. I think Knickerbocker might need to turn in for the evening. It's ok though, Diagnosis Murder is on followed by the evening news. Cheer up!

My colleague found this room on http://quickbook.com for just over $200, which I thought was quite the deal for a quality hotel during summer in Chicago. She seemed quite happy with her 3 nights in the hotel as well, her only complaint being that the walls were super thin so you can hear everything in the neighboring hotel rooms.

I stay in Chicago quite often for business and pleasure, and this was my first time at the Allerton. Sure, the location was great as many point out, but there are countless other hotels in the area. A couple of blocks takes at most a few minutes to walk, and in the end, staying the night at another hotel would be much better.The hotel staff was friendly enough and my experience with them was positive. The downsides of the hotel greatly outweigh whatever positives the employees and location provide. First off, the rooms are incredibly tiny. Sure, it's the city, but I've never been in a room so small in Chicago. Secondly, my room was actually dirty. The bedsheets had sand in them when I went to sleep, and I'm guessing someone got a sandy towel stuck with the laundry that day. However, the maid should have noticed the sheets were dirty when she put them on the bed. There was also mold on the ceiling of the bathroom, something I've never seen in a hotel at this price point. Finally, I had purchased a park and play package, and never received the ""play"" part of the deal, which was supposed to include a welcome kit and free wi-fi. Instead, I was told I needed to purchase wi-fi, the packages starting at $10. What really was the worst part of the experience was the bed and the ""valet"" parking. When coming to the city, I look forward to getting a good rest on a nice mattress. The mattress at the Allerton was horrible. I've never had a problem at any hotel I've stayed at in the city. The mattresses are thin and old, so old in fact that you can feel the springs when you lay down on it! I woke up incredibly sore, from my back to my neck. I would equate the beds to something you would find at a Red Roof Inn! I did not pay almost $200/night for that. As far as the valet parking goes, avoid it at ALL costs. When I picked my car up before leaving, it took them over 30 minutes to bring me my car. I thought valet parking wasn't supposed to be a headache?! The parking allows for ""come and go"" access, meaning once they park you, you can come in and out of the parking garage throughout your stay. I can't imagine wasting a half hour of my time each time I wanted to leave!I wanted to like the Allerton, but I just can't. I love the decor, and it's very modern and clean. The did a great job on that end. I'm not normally picky, but for the price I was expecting much more. I normally don't complain about hotels (it might seem like it in this review), but I have never been so disappointed. Would I stay here if the price was lower? Yes.

There is a very dimly-lit makeup mirror that did little to no good. The beds and pillows were very comfy. My main complaint in the room was the windows - they did very little to drown out the street noise and we were 22 stories high! Drawing the curtains did offer some help, but the blaring sirens that we heard throughout the night sounded like they were right in the room with us. Staff was friendly, concierge was extremely helpful, valet was professional. We had to wait well beyond check-in time for our room to be ready which was a pain, but they gave my husband some free drink tickets to use while we waited. Too bad the free drinks didn't help us as it was a family trip and we aren't big drinkers. Overall it was a good experience, made especially good by spending time with my awesome family.

This is my favorite place to stay in Chicago.  It is absolutely stately. I feel like I'm staying with ""history and elegance"" every time I'm here. I get a nice corporate rate. You can't beat the location, so close to the El. The other reviews do a nice job of describing the beauty. Finally, please pay attention to this simple tip: Get your Hilton Honors number before you stay here and be sure you present it before you check in, everytime. The points add up quick in a high dollar place like this. Once you get Diamond status, you are comp'd to the Executive Level, where you get free breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres. You get your own elevator (down stairs) that goes express to the upper levels. The view of the lake is phenomenal from the breakfast room. This is a grande dame from another era, still breathing life into the Loop. Stay here once, regardless of the cost.

The rooms are a little small, but they are very clean and comfortable. Perfect for a couple or someone visiting the city alone. The staff was very friendly and they let us check in early, which worked out great! Parking was free if you have a hybrid- we don't, but could have saved a lot of money on parking if we did! There is a small spa in the hotel. We had thought about scheduling massages, but it didn't seem to get much service which concerned us. So, we decided against it. There is also a restaurant that connects to the lobby. We had free breakfast tickets from the hotel. It was overpriced for what it was, and they were short staffed- and service was horrible. I wouldn't pay to eat here, but it was alright for a free meal. Despite the restaurant, spa, and smaller rooms, I would stay here again. The rooms and bathrooms are very clean (newly remodeled) and comfortable! I would definitely recommend it!

I checked in the first night and shared a regular double room with a friend. We noticed that the room smelled a little funky, like wet horses or something. Turns out the air conditioner was leaking water and the dampness had made the sheepskin mattress toppers start to smell a little... sheep-y. We reported the issue in the morning and they very promptly and apologetically offered to switch the room. I was able to check into my own room at the same time, so they gave us two adjoining rooms. I'd booked one of their ""junior suites,"" which turned out to be AMAZING - a huge corner room with a murphy bed, a full living room, a bar, and a kitchenette. Add in my friend's room next door and we basically had a two-bed, two-bath living space that was bigger than a typical apartment. The corner room had a breathtaking view of downtown Chicago, and I snapped a lot of photos at different times of day and night of all of the iconic tall buildings. The murphy bed was pretty cool and actually quite comfortable for something that also folds into the wall! I've stayed in fancier hotels, but this place takes the prize for a truly fantastic room. I had breakfast every morning at the Weber Grill, which has a pretty typical buffet to offer. The hotel is close enough to a variety of convenience stores and supermarkets that you can stock up on some basics and keep them in the room. I really liked the location and got a great deal on that suite when I stayed there. I always check the prices when I'm coming back to Chicago.

It was completely comfortable, and the staff were courteous. They were quite understanding and helpful while working out a little error in our reservation. The concierge (Bill) was remarkably friendly and helpful!  Little inconveniences keep this from being a five-star review: sometimes the elevators were slow, the bathroom was awkward to share, the wireless internet wasn't free (I know - but if it had been, I'd have been impressed!), and the television channels had a strange numbering system that I never figured out (no channel guide in the room). Those are little things, but in the interest of saving a five-star review for a truly wonderful place, I'm holding back in this case. I'm not hard to please, though, and I'd recommend this place/stay there again.Other useful things to know: 1. The room (king bed) had a fridge, iron & ironing board, single-mug coffee maker (powder creamer), and hair dryer.2. The bathroom came with plenty of linens of course, face soap, body soap, shampoo (which didn't lather a whole lot but got the job done), and conditioner.3. The weight room had exercise bikes, treadmills, elliptical trainers, nautilus-type machines, and free weights. There wasn't a space with mats to lie down but I liked the rest of it. It looked out on the pool.4. I never saw a room-service menu. But I didn't look hard; just went across the street to Kitty O'Shea's (in the Hilton) and ordered out.

Because I get a specialty discount, I was able to stay there twice for $110 a night for our anniversary. Living in Chicago, it's important to have a place in town where we can go and just have a great experience and feel like we're on vacation. Whenever a family member from CT is coming to visit, I always recommend them to stay here. In fact, my parents are coming in a few weeks and they'll be staying for just $217 a night which is really great for downtown hotel. When you first walk into the Palmer House, the first thing you are greeted with is a beautiful lobby, high ceiling painted like the sistine chapel. This lobby is gorgeous and I don't think I've ever seen one like it anywhere else. There is a bar and restaurant attached and both are very high end. Upstairs, the rooms are spacious and funny enough even smell really good! I don't know, but something about the whole place just feels rich. The bathrooms are all granite and marble and everything is always clean. The pool and hot tub are immaculate and top quality, but get a little busy with families and small children. The hotel is in a great location, I think 0,0 right at the point where the streets become N and S. Anyway, its right near the park and in the busiest shopping area on State St. also not far from Block37 and the Chicago Theater. Not just a great hotel - amazing hotel. Good enough for even Chicago residents to stay at for a night away.

The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. It seemed like 4-star service at a 3-star price. The room was very comfortable; the mattress and pillows were cushy to my taste. I loved seeing the Chicago skyline from my window. I enjoyed a quick workout in the small-ish but clean fitness center. Although it was small, it didn't feel claustrophobic. The windows helped. I also have to compliment the spa. Again, it was very small, but I actually prefer the coziness. The massage therapist gave me one of the best I've had. At $85, it was well worth it. I ate dinner after the massage, and pretty much slipped into food coma after that. Luckily I had a comfy bed, and a big old TV with movie rentals. I totally girled out and rented a chick flick. What better way to spend some days off?  The location is great to walk to various places downtown, but I can't really recommend hanging out downtown. There are much better places to spend your time and money. Fortunately there are plenty of train lines around. I highly recommend a stay at the Felix.

The private room is cozier, especially if you can get a group of ~30 people or so. Be careful with the table service, they might rip you off (paid $250 for one bottle of Absolut!).

We know not to keep them near cell phones, etc. so something is amiss with their key/lock systems. It was quite annoying having to go all the way up our 4th floor room only to have to go back down to get another key, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I'm not exaggerating. Also, the furnace or whatever it was (sorry, I'm a FL girl so I have no idea what it's called) seemed to work only when it wanted and it got extremely hot in the room at times. Each night we had to leave the the window open so the temperature was tolerable, but even opening the window didn't work very well. After alerting the front desk to our issues, they simply shrugged it off and said it should be working. This place wasn't expensive, but I've stayed in equally inexpensive places and never had these issues. I think I will pick somewhere else when staying in Lincoln Park.

Did I mention that this new-age chill-out music plays everywhere , 24/7 at the W? It can become more grating than calming. The room had a great view, the beds were comfy and the bathroom was cool and well stocked with Bliss spa products.

I contacted the front desk and they apologized and offered a credit at their on site restaurant but we had already had reservations at another restaurant and this didn't really replace the item that was disposed of. We left a little disappointed and I wondered why they didn't just replace the pizza as the pizza place (Giordano's) was literally just around the corner. I arrive home and within a day or two I receive an email survey from Omni hotels. In the survey I describe the situation. Within 2 days I get another email from the Omni hotel with their apologies and an offer to ship a replacement out to me in California via FedEx overnight for the Giordano's pizza that was thrown out!

I did stay on off days (Sun - Tues), but the doormen to the front desk personnel seemed to know me every time I came through the lobby.

I mean, what's not to like about a hotel in downtown Chicago, close to everything, especially the theater district, that offers impeccable service in a contemporary environment? Read on, I say. It had been a long day and while I rarely stay in the city since I live here- I was treating my team to a little outing and they wanted to stay in the city so who am I to say no? Due to other commitments, I got to the hotel late and checked in. The lobby is up one level from the street and is decorated in a fun and contemporary way. Know that Kimpton Hotels are pet friendly so I had to maneuver my way around a couple of dogs that had made themselves at home in the front lobby. The desk clerk checked me in quickly and I was in my room moments later. I loved the room layout. I had a corner room with lots of windows, plush pillows on the bed, and a comfy chair. The bed was turned down, the radio on and as I was unpacking my bag I spied two animal print robes in the closet. Rrrrrrrrrrrr! I slipped into one and nibbled a bit on the basket of fruit and cheese that had been sent to the room. Wanting to have a glass of wine to go with it- I went over to the mini bar. It was at this point that I noticed that my mini bar key was broken and no amount of ""finagling"" on my part would open the door. Oh well. I didn't need that wine anyway is what my rational side was saying. My emotional side? Was already whining about no wine! As I settled in for bed- it seemed like a good idea to use the bathroom before I turned in. Imagine my surprise when I flushed and all the water came up instead of going down. Urrgh! Made me think about who the heck was in the room before me? I called down to the front desk and they said they would send an engineer up right away. Oh great. Here I am in my cute leopard print robe. That would never do for a ""visitor"". So I got dressed again to await the man with the steel snake (Trust me. That sounds more interesting than it was!) Other than those two issues and valet parking that was a third of the cost of the room ($48- can you believe that for one night? $42 if you park it yourself) my stay was perfect. Complimentary coffee brought up in the morning, Aveda toiletries in the bathroom, plush towels, chocolates, free wireless, flat screen TV's, everything that I would expect from a hotel of this caliber. And the price was right. You can get a negotiated rate of about $150 - $190 per night which is cheap for this part of town. Would I recommend it? You betcha. Only next time I'm going to flush the toilet BEFORE I put the cute leopard print robe on.

I just love the style of that place! The W Chicago is great-- right on the lake, slightly tucked away from Michigan ave, but close enough that you can get to some of the great shopping areas. The real reasons I come to the W: Bliss Spa, and the Mojitos. Some of the best in the city, and I'm a snobby mojito whore. They do some great variations, with crushed blueberrys, rasberrys, or mango... and one wednesday a month they do special mojitos with a medley of pineapple and some other crap... and part of the proceeds go to The Humane Society.. getting drunk for a good cause?? Can't beat that. I will say they tend to be rather expensive, and you can't really go there dressed uber casual without looking a little out of place. Throw on some lipgloss, a cute top, and your good to go. Another thing= The bathrooms are awesome. I'm pretty sure the glass between the mens and womens rooms are see through, so if you look hard enough, you can probably get a free show... not that I would know or anything. Bliss Spa is great too, and kudos to them for associating themselves with such a great name in the Hotel industry!! One more thing, the bar upstairs, I think it's called the Whiskey- has an amazing view of the skyline. Everything in the bar is black, so if your drunk enough, it feels like you are floating in the black abyss. I love it.  If you ever get a chance, check out the W in LA... that's where my love affair began!

This review, however, is for my spa day I recently had here. I was treated to one of their 3 1/2 hour packages which included Swedish massage, facial and classic mani/pedi. The receptionist greeted me when I got there and showed me to the shower/locker room. It was decent, but I was surprised to see those generic brown paper towels at the sink--the ones that smell when you dry your hands with them. Totally not a big deal, but this is a spa, after all... I'll forgive them for that one, though, since the robes were so comfy. Before my first treatment, they took me to the relaxation room, which is kind of an oxymoron because you're stuck in a very very dimly lit room with other people in robes, and it's anything but relaxing. Worries like, ""am I exposing any bits & pieces,"" etc. There are some magazines but it's so dark I'm not sure how you're expected to read them. My first treatment was a massage. It was heavenly... The pressure was just right and I really liked whatever lotion/oil that was used, because I didn't feel slimy and gross at the end like you sometimes do after a massage. From there, I had a facial. I'd never had one before, and I have to say it was my favorite part of the package. I didn't do anything special, just a regular ""refresher"" since I have relatively sensitive skin. The woman who did my facial was really good about asking about skin allergies and whatnot. The facial was very relaxing, too (minus the extraction part).  After my facial, I had a mani/pedi. Unfortunately, this was my least favorite part of the treatment. Maybe because I get them regularly and my experience was just standard at the Dana? Honestly, I prefer my regular neighborhood salon to my experience at the Dana. The woman went a little overboard with the bubbles; it actually felt like my feet were soaking in Dawn. Also, the scrub was done really quickly--kind of felt like I got ripped off on that part. The manicure was just okay, too.  One other thing to note, I'm not sure where, but I somehow got jipped in terms of time. It was supposed to be a 3.5 hour package, and I was out of there in just 3 hours (maybe even a little less). The massage and facial felt like they took ample time, so I have a feeling it was the mani/pedi that were a little shorter than advertised.

Another nice feature about this hotel is that it does have a little bit newer/updated dcor, but it does not make it ""luxury"" or 4 star by any means. The main entrance takes you to a small lobby area with some seating and a station for the bellmen, and then a hall that leads to the elevators. The elevators are very small, but luckily we didn't have to wait too long for 1. The check-in/reservation desk, as well as the concierge table, bar/lounge, and restaurant are located on the 2nd floor. I never saw anyone at the concierge table - - would have been a problem had we stayed more than 1 night. The bellman was helpful in assisting with the few questions I did have, though. Check-in/out was fine. We had no problem leaving our bags with the bellmen when we arrived early/before check-in or after check-out. They were able to retrieve our bags quickly with no issues. We had a standard king room and it was very small. I don't mind a small room, but I was surprised by how small it the room was. The TV was nice, there was a desk, the bed looked nice with white bedding and navy piping. The closet was tiny, but again, we were only staying for 1 night, so not a big deal. I think these accommodations are ok for a night or weekend, but I would have been cramped had I been staying for an extended period of time (a week or more). I have read this before, and I will have to agree 100% that the sheets are extremely rough and scratchy! My husband and I both commented on the low quality sheets, which was disappointing. I think nice sheets can make such a huge difference in a hotel. I slept well despite the scratchy sheets. The pillows were soft and comfy.A word of warning: THE WALLS ARE VERY THIN!!!! During the day I heard the man in the room next to us talking on his cell phone. He was speaking with a normal tone/volume and I could hear the entire conversation very clearly, as if he was in the room. That being said, we woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of our neighbors...! WHOA! They weren't even that loud, it was honestly that the walls were incredibly thin. Eeek.The bathroom was small and had a pedestal sink, no counter space, and a more industrial looking toilet with the flush handle similar to a commercial toilet (it's an old hotel). The shower was nice, the marble was nice, and the shower head was actually pretty good and provided decent water pressure and a rainfall spray. The toiletries were limited and included a bar of soap, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion. They smelled pleasant, but I would have appreciated a shower cap and maybe a body wash.  The towels were fine, they got me dry, but they were quite standard. I guess if you have more toiletries and more luxury towels, the price of the room would just go up, so again, it's what your priorities are, right? I think the hotel, the room, and the bathroom appeared to be clean, but not spotless. If I had been staying for more than 1 night I would have expected more in the way of cleanliness.Overall, I would say this hotel is average - convenient location, nice , but old.  Allerton is definitely not a boutique or luxury hotel, so if that is what you are expecting, you will be disappointed (note that this review is based on a standard king and I am unable to provide an opinion on any upgraded rooms they may offer). We were comfortable and didn't have any major issues or complaints.  I think just having softer, higher quality sheets could make a huge difference in the experience, though. People don't always use the other amenities in a hotel (desk, TV, closet, etc.) but they almost always need a comfortable place to rest (with silky sheets!) We probably won't stay here again, because there are so many other options and I'm not opposed to spending a little more for a true luxury hotel.

It is based on my stay here from July 28 to August 3, 2012. The review is broken into categories. Location!Location! Location!: 4 stars   The location is in the heart of downtown Chicago on busy N. Street halfway between U.S. Cellular (Comisky) Park and Wrigley Field. It is convenient to public transit. The El runs underground along State Street. It is near to Chicago icons including the Magnificent Mile, The Chicago River, The Loop, and the Navy Pier. The nearby dining choices are commendable. They include Weber Grill (I rated it 4 stars), Rock Bottom Steak House (I rated it 3 stars), Pizanos Chicago Pizza (I rated it 4 stars), Pizzaria Uno, and a dictionary worth of others. Suites: Its a suite not a room-3&1/2 stars  Embassy Suites rents 2 room suites. They are spacious, yet not perfect. The Maids did a remarkable job maintaining the cleaniness of the room. The beds were comfortable. There are two beds in the master bedroom and a couch that converts to a bed in the secondary bedroom. The refrigerator allowed me to load up on healthy snacks from the nearby Trader Joe's. Just like the two other Embassy Suites, I stayed in, bathroom ventilators were nonexistent. Being a suite, a closet is more justified than a cabinet. East-facing rooms have a natural alarm clock. Owing to the fact that the drapes fail to close all the way, I found myself rising with the sun. The suites shut out the noise from the adjacent room at the same time there is noise exposed from the adjacent suite into the secondary room. Amenities: This ain't Motel 6- 4 stars  Staying in Embassy Suites satisfies my vacation philosophy of coffee by day and alcohol by night. The Manager's Reception has got to be the greatest amenity happening in the hotel industry. From 5:30 to 7:30, the base floor of the atrium turns into an open bar. Drinks are unlimited, with the exception that you can only pick up one drink at a time due to state law. After 2 hours at the Manager's Reception, my stress was momentarily history. In the morning Embassy Suites provides a freshly made breakfast buffet. And it is good. However, it gets crowded. The hotel gets taken over by guests carrying around plates of breakfast. In my case, I use the other breakfast amenity, the Starbuck's downstairs, and the Starbuck's stores within a couple blocks radius of the hotel. For people wanting more than coffee and alcohol, there is a swimming pool and hot tub. The water temperature was satisfactory. They stay open to midnight. Nearby to the swimming pool is a gym.  In the atrium is a business center. I never failed to get a computer. The business center comes in handy on account of the fact that wifi is an extra charge and a high phone signal is sporadic. Conclusion: One more 4 star Embassy Suites.  Embassy Suites-a Hilton division- has yet to let me down. This is one more Embassy Suites that I recommend.

Unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming experience, to say the least.  But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel. First off, it is located my favorite part of Chicago - the leafy, affluent part of town that is Chicago's equivalent of Manhattan's Upper East Side, complete with sidewalks, quiet tree-lined streets, real old-school townhouses (instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums), cute boutiques (instead of Gap, Banana Republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands) and, of course, Hermes of Paris (which warrants a separate mention).  I also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches, cherry colored wooden furnitures, area rugs and distinct artwork. The very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains.  I definitely love the room. While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan, getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task. So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous, ample bathroom, double sink, massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around, do a chicken dance, and strut my Herve and Louboutins in. My only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room, but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us, so can't have it all! Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service, or lack thereof. I mean, seriously. They don't call it the 'hospitality' industry for no reason. I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say, a 3000-room Vegas hotel.  First, I called in to reconfirm my reservation. The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent. First off, she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff, to whom I had to explain myself all over again (my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service). The person who manned the reception desk was not friendly, nor was he at all competent either. Case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in, which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there.  But the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1AM. As a general rule, I am never, ever, a big fan of room service, having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity, 10.5% tax (and still expect a tip) on during my days globetrotting on the company's expense account. Think overcooked steaks, lukewarm soup, bread hard enough to knock someone out, and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite. So I really wasn't expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24-hour room service, but lo and behold, they do. I placed an order of chicken BLT, which (to my initial delight) came in within 20 minutes. Then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of $2 on top of the 18% service fee (refer above) I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin, microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lay's chips (lightly salted flavor). The bread looked like someone stomped on it, the L and T looked like it was 2 days old, the B was unrecognizable, and the chicken was burnt and cold. It was pathetic room service at its finest.  We did get the item taken off our bill (rightfully so too) but the front desk person was, instead of apologetic, defiant. The whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving, it's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. We won't be coming back, unfortunately.

I like the Drake's ""old-fashioned"" feel and authentic atmosphere. With all the renovations happening everyday, it's nice to visit somewhere from another time. As for the tea, I think it's something everyone should experience once in their life. The food was good--finger sandwiches, scones, tea (obviously). And the tea was even better. Compared to the Ritz, tea at the Drake seemed more believable, more appropriate.

Now onto the bad side.... We found cut toenails on the floor of our hotel, I was thinking maybe even the cleaning ladies didn't want to clean it up so they left it there. That was on our first night so we were not pleased. They charge you for calling out of your room, and DOWN THE STREET. not happy about that either. The atmosphere was good, down the street from Navy peir, and we almost stayed because of a gymnastics meet I went to. Okay, Not recommmended, but a place stay.

I officiated my friends wedding here and helped with a lot of the planning details.  When I heard my friends were getting married at the Holiday Inn because it was a fantastic deal, I was happy that they found something that fit their budget, but I wasn't expecting it to be super classy. I was so wrong. Barbara, the in-house the wedding planner was a breeze for the bride and groom to work with. She was calm and thought of everything. I too found communicating with her to be very easy.  The food was well beyond my expectations. The salad was not your average crank them out wedding salad. The greens were fresh, the string beans delicious. If you told me I was eating local organic produce, I would have believed you. The steaks were so thick and delicious you would have thought this was a $150 per plate wedding meal, which I'm sure it was not. The Holiday Inn outsources their cakes to Alliance Bakery. I'm not a big wedding cake fan - because most just aren't that great. This one was fantastic. (Chocolate buttercream, chocolate cake, raspberry filling.) The venue let our friends bring in their own beer from outside. This is unheard of at a hotel wedding venue. Upcharging alcohol is a big part of how they make their money. But our friends were able to pick up fantastic beer and bring it in to be served at the bar. It saved them a bundle. They had an open bar all night long. I'm not big into mixed drinks so I cannot comment on that aspect. Free rooms were included for the bride and groom and parents on the night of the wedding. The couple said that nice perks like that were present throughout their whole experience. The only things I did not like were: They typically don't provide a holding room for the wedding party to wait in. The part of the room where they stood for their ceremony had an exit door and exit sign right behind them. Not the most beautiful backdrop to a wedding ceremony. And when the clock struck leaving time - they threw on the florescent lights and herded everyone out as though it were a police raid. I have worked catering and understand well the need to get guests out so crew can start to breakdown. I'm sure their method was effective in doing so, but they could have used some more tact.  These negatives were minor compared to the service, the good price, the good food, and great views. I think this is one of the best kept secrets as far as Chicago wedding venues go. Five stars indeed.

We reserved the room online from their website, and by doing so we got free wifi - holler. but all in all it was a good stay. We checked in around 7pm and the Tower King room i reserved were all taken so I got upgraded for free to a Tower King Suite, which was SWEET. It was very spacious and had great views. Windows on 3 different walls, the only direction we did not have a view of was to the west, and being that I live in West Loop, I wasn't missing much.  The windows were huge, the bathroom was huge as well, but the only qualm we had with the room was the shower was a little weird. The floor of the shower was continuous with that of the rest of the bathroom. It wasn't a problem, just kind of surprising.  We had 2 TVs, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. A good variety of channels. The bed was a legit King and was very comfortable. One other thing, there wasn't as much ""hard rock"" stuff as I would have anticipated. We had a picture of Marilyn Manson in our room which was a little creepy but not bad haha. But If there were more little music/rock things around the room it would have felt 'cooler.' But all in all it was a fantastic stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and would love to stay here again.

From start to finish, Barbara Martin, the catering manager, was very easy to work with and very accommodating. The view from the Wolf Point Ballroom is great. It looks out over the river and makes this more than just another hotel ballroom.  Another nice surprise was that the food was amazing. I don't tend to expect much of wedding food, but I must say that ours was delicious. We chose chicken napoleon with roasted vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.  I had people telling me all night that they loved it. The cake (from Alliance Bakery) was included in our package and that was great, too. And I didn't have to do any coordinating. The bakery dealt directly with Barbara.  The rooms that they blocked out for us were also very nice. The rooms for both sets of parents were free, as was our bridal suite which was spectacular. It was huge, had a nice view of the city, and there was free champagne and cookies waiting for us. We, and our parents, also got free breakfast the next morning.  I definitely recommend having an event there. We really wanted a downtown wedding and at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza we were able to get it without spending a crazy amount of money.

Besides the desk, there are really no places to put anything since the nightstands are so small and with the lamp on each one leaves no room for anything else. No dresser - the only drawers were in the tiny nightstand. There was no space in the bathroom for toiletries. Somehow I got a handicapped bathroom, so it was huge but had no space at the same time. I do have to say that the water in the shower/tub was really hot. The menu in the restaurant didn't look all that great to me and was slightly overpriced. There is a wine reception from 4:30-5:30 each day and the bar/lounge area was nice for a drink. The location is great - right in the middle of Michigan Avenue. This is my new corporate hotel, so we'll see if I got a flukey random room this time and will get a better room next time. I'll be visiting the Allerton often in the future.
